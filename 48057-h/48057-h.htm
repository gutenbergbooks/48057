<h2 id="PREFATORY">PREFATORY</h2>

<p>The series of studies contained in this volume is in
no way a history of the Tudor period. My object
in preparing it has been first to form in my own mind
and secondly to present to my readers a clear and
consistent conception of the character of sundry
persons, who in their own day either exercised an
effective influence on the course of politics, or embodied
political ideas which have influenced succeeding
generations. The events narrated are considered
not in the light of their intrinsic importance, but
as they bear on the particular character under investigation.</p>

<p>To arrive at a fair estimate of any man’s character,
the primary necessity is to endeavour to realise his
point of view, to appreciate his preconceptions. If
we require of him that his preconceptions shall
coincide with our own, we may reconstruct an interesting
dramatic figure, but we shall not discover
the man as he really was. And if we do succeed in
placing ourselves at his point of view, we shall almost
inevitably find that the man who ultimately emerges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
is different from, and probably somewhat better
than, the man as we had previously conceived him.</p>

<p>Concerning these ten figures, two curious points
may be noted. Eight of them may be described as
ministers: not one of the eight was actually of noble
birth, two were not even of gentle birth. That
fact emphasises the change in the political centre
of gravity which accompanied the establishment of
the Tudor Dynasty. Secondly, of those eight, four
perished on the scaffold and one at the stake: a
sixth was in custody under accusation of treason
when death released him. That illustrates not less
emphatically the distance at which we stand from
the Tudors to-day.</p>

<h2 id="HENTRY_VII">HENRY VII</h2>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>

<p>“This King, to speak of him in terms equal to his
deserving, was one of the best sort of wonders, a
wonder for wise men.” In those words Francis
Bacon summed up Henry VII., a hundred years after
the first Tudor king had been laid in his grave.
Bacon’s history still is, and is likely to remain, the
classic narrative. Not that he was a “contemporary,”
or that he had access to any extraordinary
sources of information; but because being at once
a practical politician, a student of political theory,
and a literary artist, any historical work from his
pen could hardly have failed to be of the highest
interest, and the subject he actually chose was&mdash;to
him&mdash;peculiarly sympathetic.</p>

<p>It is in fact quite evident that Henry was held in
the very highest estimation by his biographer. The
history is addressed to Prince Charles, and it can
hardly be doubted that in calling his hero “the
English Solomon,” Bacon had in mind the reigning
king’s description as the “Scottish Solomon”;
the direct suggestion of a parallel (repeated in other
terms in the Preface) must have been meant to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
looked upon as a compliment by James. Henry
was at least to be accounted the shrewdest ruler
amongst the very astute princes who were more or
less his contemporaries. Yet, for all the impression
of shrewdness, Bacon fails to win our sympathy for
Henry, perhaps because those two minds had too
close kinship. Bacon, except in the case of a few
enthusiasts, does not inspire affection. Pope’s summary
is too accurate an expression of what is at least
the popular conception; and Henry is judged to
have been not quite so bright, nearly but not quite
so wise&mdash;and still more mean. English history provides
examples of monarchs whom every one actively
hates like King John, or scorns like Edward II.;
other monarchs too, who, if they had evil qualities,
yet display something of the heroic; towards whom
our feelings, if mixed, are still warm. But Henry VII.
inspires almost universally a strong sentiment of
cold dislike, such as no one else creates.</p>

<p>There is justice in that impression, but there is
also injustice. In his latter years, it is hardly too
much to call him detestable. He had reigned for
fourteen years before he committed the one commonplace
crime of tyrants which stains his record, the
execution of Warwick. From that time a kind of
degeneration seems to have come upon him, accelerated
by the deaths first of his wisest counsellor
Morton, then, two years later, of the son he loved,
and then of his wife. To these years belongs nearly
every story which tells seriously to his discredit.
But during the earlier and longer half of his reign,
his record is remarkably free from blemish, and shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
an enlightenment which under happier conditions
might have won him a place not only among the
kings who have deserved well of the State&mdash;that,
at least in the historian’s eyes, he did achieve&mdash;but
among those whose memory posterity have
cherished.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">HENRY’S EARLY YEARS, ACCESSION, AND
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DYNASTY</span></h3>

<p>After the death of Henry V., his widow accepted
in marriage the hand of a Welsh knight of ancient
lineage, Owen Tudor. In 1456, their son Edmund
Tudor, Earl of Richmond, took to himself a very
youthful bride, the Lady Margaret Beaufort, the
representative of John of Gaunt’s family by Katherine
Swynford, legitimatised by Act of Parliament in
the reign of Richard II. On January 28, 1457,
Margaret gave birth to a son, Henry, some weeks
after Edmund himself had died; the charge of the
boy devolving mainly upon Edmund’s brother
Jasper, Earl of Pembroke. During the next fourteen
years, the great Earl of Warwick was playing see-saw
with the fortunes of the rival houses of York and
Lancaster. In 1461, the Yorkists won the upper
hand; but Jasper held out in Wales for Lancaster,
for nearly seven years. Then Harlech Castle was
surrendered, and young Henry was placed in charge
of its captor, the new Earl of Pembroke, and was
well enough treated. Then Lancaster had a turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of success, but the party was crushed at the battles
of Barnet and Tewkesbury, and the line was quenched
by the deaths of Henry VI. and his son. Yorkists
and Lancastrians alike fixed upon young Henry
Tudor as being now the representative of John of
Gaunt; England was too dangerous a habitation
for a possible claimant to the throne; and the boy
in his fifteenth year was successfully shipped off by
his friends to Brittany, where for twelve years he
abode under the Duke’s protection.</p>

<p>If the dynasty of York had established itself in
regular fashion&mdash;if Edward IV. had been followed
by an Edward V. as Henry IV. had been followed by
Henry V.&mdash;there would have been little enough to
fear. But Edward’s brother usurped the throne
by a particularly foul murder, and being on it proved
himself a tyrant. Men’s eyes turned to the one scion
of the Plantagenets whom it was possible to set up
as a claimant to the crown. If he could be set on
the throne with Edward’s daughter at his side, the
rival factions of York and Lancaster might be stilled.
The first attempt to challenge the usurper failed
completely. Buckingham’s plan of campaign was
ruined by the flooding of the Severn, and by a storm
which scattered the fleet wherewith Richmond sailed
from Brittany to co-operate. Henry, returning
thither, had to flee very soon after to safer shelter
in France. But it was not long before the attempt
was renewed, this time with success. On Bosworth
field Richard was slain, and Henry declared King
of England.</p>

<p>The victor was a young man of eight-and-twenty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
For fourteen years he had lived in England, amidst
civil broils and perpetual alarms. For fourteen more
he had lived mainly in Brittany, conscious that he
was in perpetual danger of being surrendered into
the hands of those who might at any time find his
destruction convenient. All his life he had been
in an atmosphere of suspicion, of possible treachery,
encompassed with deeds of blood. He had learned
to study others and to trust himself. He had learned
that his life might depend on alertness and self-restraint.
And he had been able to see that Louis XI.
was incomparably the most successful master of
state-craft of his generation. These were lessons
calculated to kill all youthful qualities, and at twenty-eight
Henry might as well have been forty.</p>

<p>This was the man who had grasped a sceptre to
which it was impossible to establish for him a legal
title. In plain truth, he was King of England
because he was the only man of the blood-royal who
was able to challenge the usurper who was wearing
the crown. As far as right of inheritance went, if
Edward IV.’s daughters were barred by their sex,
the son of Clarence was indubitably the heir of
Edward III., whether descent through the female line
were admitted or no. Henry might marry Elizabeth
of York and claim the crown in her right; but then
her death would leave him in a highly anomalous
position; it was imperative that he should be accepted
himself as the lawful king in his own person. The
marriage might make matters perfectly safe for a
son, but not for him. Hence even the semblance of
depending on his wife’s title must be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
He had won the realm by the sword; that was the
first step. The second was to commit the representatives
of the nation to affirm that he was the lawful
sovereign: this was effected by a Declaratory Act in
Parliament, which judiciously abstained from naming
the grounds on which his claim rested. After that
was to come the marriage, which should muzzle the
partisans of York. This took place in the following
January; but it is easy to see that the king had
good reason for not proceeding to his wife’s coronation
at least till a son should be born. Not long
after that son was born, the Simnel plot was brewing;
the coronation under those circumstances might
have taken the colour of a defensive measure. Consequently
the ceremony was not performed until
Elizabeth had been his wife for very nearly two years,
being thus emphasised as a mere act of grace.</p>

<p>No doubt if, by marrying the Plantagenet princess,
Henry could have appropriated the Yorkist title
to himself personally whether his queen lived or
died, he would have been able to do without repressing
the heads of the Yorkist faction at all. But,
as things stood, that could not be risked. Warwick,
Clarence’s young son, was imprisoned in the Tower,
and some of the last king’s principal supporters
were attainted. Being thus kept dissatisfied, it
was a long time before active Yorkist plots ceased.
The Dowager Duchess of Burgundy, Margaret,
sister of Edward IV., made her Court a regular centre
of anti-Tudor intrigue; nor did Henry ever feel
really safe till the myth of a surviving Richard of
York was finally exploded and the actual Edward
Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, had been done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
death. The course which Henry took involved a
certain degree of injustice&mdash;but <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fiat Justitia, Ruat
Cælum</i>, is a maxim that princes with an uncertain
title are rarely, if ever, disposed to adopt without
reservation. One is disposed to wonder rather that
Warwick was allowed to live so long than that Henry
ultimately yielded to the temptation to slay him.</p>

<p>This plain business of securing himself on the
throne was necessarily the first consideration. Only
an established dynasty could restore steady government
in a country which within a hundred years
had seen four kings slain and the great bulk of her
ancient baronage wiped out. Between foreign wars,
successful or the reverse, and a wild warfare of armed
factions at home, stability had been destroyed. The
prolonged reign of strong rulers maintaining one
policy was an absolute condition of recuperation.
The way in which Henry secured it was entirely
characteristic and entirely successful. The sword,
the poniard, and the headman’s axe or the dungeon,
were normally relied on by rulers whose seat was
uncertain. Henry acted on a strictly original
scheme. When he took the field against rebels, he
sent before him proclamations of pardon to those
who would come in; and he kept his word. He did
not massacre the routed foe: he spared them,
seizing only their leaders. He was responsible for
no murders. A Lambert Simnel or a Perkin Warbeck
when captured was not hanged out of hand, but sent
to join the scullions, or set in the stocks as an impostor.
Executions were singularly rare; rebels
who might become powerful merely had their claws
clipped by fines and confiscations&mdash;very efficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
clipped, no doubt. Where imprisonment was
resorted to, the confinement was seldom harsh;
and the king never had qualms about restoring a
quondam rebel to favour and authority, if he judged
that his man would show himself worthy of the faith
reposed in him. When Surrey’s gaoler offered to let
him go free, Surrey refused to escape; the king
had put him in ward, and the king alone should
release him. The king did so, and gave him a
command of the highest trust. Kildare set authority
at defiance when he was Deputy in Ireland, and when
he was deposed, “All Ireland cannot rule this man,”
said his enemies. “Then let this man rule all Ireland,”
quoth Henry, and restored him to the Deputyship.
Neither Surrey nor Kildare gave him cause
for repentance.</p>

<p>Such a record would have entitled Henry to praise
as a prince of unparalleled magnanimity, but for its
common-sense accompaniment of fines and confiscations.
But in fact, to penalise rebellion in some
sort was an absolute necessity; not to have done so
would have jeopardised the throne. The method
adopted might not be heroic, but it was supremely
practical; inasmuch as it wrought the minimum
of positive injury to the punished, while at once
depriving them of power to harm and supplying the
king himself with the sinews of government, of
which he was sorely in need. It was dictated quite
as much by policy as by magnanimity, but the mere
fact that Henry recognised it from the outset as
sounder policy than any precedents, recent at any
rate, suggested, is testimony to the acuteness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
moral perceptions as well as to the keenness of his
intelligence. Nor is it fair to deprive Henry of the
credit of magnanimity, merely because the magnanimity
paid. To realise that it did pay and prove
completely successful, we have only to observe that
after the battle of Stoke there was no baronial
rising in England. Warbeck got all his support
either from the exiles or from foreign courts: when
he tried to raise the West of England on his own
account, he collapsed ignominiously. It is true that
an army of Cornish insurgents had marched to Blackheath
just before, and had there been broken up;
but that was a purely popular rising in protest
against taxation, and its chiefs were a blacksmith
and a lawyer.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE TUDOR ABSOLUTISM AND THE EXCHEQUER</span></h3>

<p>It was not sufficient, however, merely to secure the
sceptre in the hands of a strong king; it was necessary
further to establish a strong system. For half
a century the great power and estates of individual
barons had enabled them to keep the country in
perpetual turmoil. The idea of universal obedience
to the established government simply because it
was established had vanished from the military and
political classes: the idea even of concerted government
by one class, guided by its interests as a class,
had disappeared; it was only the personal factor,
personal interests, that counted. Below the baronage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the gentry who bordered on the baronage, and
their retainers, townsfolk and country folk stood
aloof from the fighting, and lived as peacefully as
they might&mdash;all things considered, with a wonderful
freedom from disturbance. But standing aloof from
the fighting, they had perforce stood aloof also from
the business of government, which fell to the military
faction that happened for the time being to have the
upper hand. They were in short ready to support
and profit by a government which gave promise of
peace and stability, order and justice; but they were
not ready to organise such a government for themselves,
or to take a prominent part in conducting it.
Under such conditions, the Yorkists had established
a despotism, as the only workable form of government.
But their despotism was one that rested
almost exclusively on the personal forcefulness of
the ruler. It was Henry’s task to keep the effective
power concentrated in the King’s hands, but to give
it a constitutional colour&mdash;to make the nation feel
it as a government by consent. It was therefore
necessary to eliminate factors which naturally
tended to disturbance&mdash;in other words, to deprive
the individual barons of the power of aggressive self-assertion;
and at the same time, so to treat the
naturally orderly elements of society as to keep
them on the side of the government.</p>

<p>This was the root-principle of the Tudor Absolutism,
devised and put into practice by the first Tudor
king, and systematically carried out by his son and
grand-daughter. The system carried England to
the first place among the nations. But it broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
down when the Stuarts ignored its fundamental
principle, and so treated the naturally orderly
elements of society as to turn them against the government.
For under the system, those elements
acquired the power of organisation and self-protection,
as the accompaniment of the prosperity they
enjoyed increasingly; and it followed that the system
could only remain stable so long as there was essential
harmony and sympathy between the monarch and
his subjects.</p>

<p>For the concentration of power, effective power,
in the king’s hands, money was essential; while to
keep the general population contented, it was necessary
that their purses should not be subjected to
too severe exactions, which must fall elsewhere.
Henry directed them against the nobility. The
nation at large had no objection; the king’s treasury
was filled and the power of the nobles curtailed by
the same operation. Thus the king eliminated the
disturbing factor, or allowed it to eliminate itself.
When noblemen got themselves mixed up with
treasons, they could not complain if their lives were
spared and their goods paid the forfeit. They had
been wont to maintain great households, every man
having in his service the nucleus of an army. These
crowds of retainers were forbidden by law, as being,
for obvious reasons, a public danger. If noblemen,
accustomed to over-ride the law, chose to keep up
their households in despite of it, they could not
expect sympathy when they were called upon to
pay in cash the penalty of breaking the law. These
measures were not only thoroughly defensible as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
being entirely free from any taint of injustice; they
also served directly to relieve taxation, to fill the
royal coffers, and to make wanton insurrection
difficult.</p>

<p>Yet, while keeping within what might be called
legitimate bounds, as he habitually did while Morton
was alive, the king undoubtedly permitted himself
to apply methods which savoured of trickery. He
made great parade of a war with France, appealing
to national patriotism to supply the funds. The
appeal was successful, but there was no corresponding
expenditure on the campaign. Excellent reasons
for inactivity were of course forthcoming, but it is
none the less certain that no activity was ever contemplated.
All that was intended was a demonstration
which might induce the French monarch to buy
the English king off with solid cash&mdash;as he eventually
did. The whole transaction was eminently profitable,
but Henry had certainly got his money out of his
own subjects by false pretences. The same plea
was resorted to, to get benevolences authorised,
when the famous dilemma traditionally&mdash;but as it
would seem quite unjustly&mdash;attributed to Cardinal
Morton was applied. People who lived handsomely
could obviously afford a contribution by curtailing
their extravagance; people who did not live handsomely
must have wealth laid by. In either case,
there could be no inability to serve the king’s need.
The spirit which prompted the invention of that
dilemma is illustrated in a story reported by Bacon
as traditional. Henry paid a visit to the Earl of
Oxford at Henningham, where he was sumptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
entertained, and on his departure passed out through
a lane of the earl’s retainers drawn up to do him
honour. “These, no doubt, are your menial
servants,” observed the king. The earl demurred;
they were not menials, but retainers, who had turned
out to do him credit when he had so distinguished a
guest. Whereupon “The king started a little,
and said, ‘By my faith, my lord, I thank you for
my good cheer, but I may not endure to have my
laws broken in my sight. My attorney must speak
with you.’ And it is part of the report that the earl
compounded for no less than fifteen thousand marks.”
It is obvious that such a story might have been
developed out of some really quite justifiable incident;
but it is tolerably certain that it was not
only in his closing years that Henry displayed what
we may call an unkingly acquisitiveness.</p>

<p>In passing, however, it may be remarked that this
was a family trait. Elizabeth inherited her grandfather’s
prejudice against spending a shilling that
could be kept in her purse, or neglecting any plausible
pretext for attracting coin into it. She also inherited
his business principle of repaying every loan
he contracted with unfailing punctuality. Henry
VIII. did not indeed practise economy, but he could
haggle over a money bargain as keenly as his father
or his daughter, and his generosity, when he indulged
it, was usually at the expense of another pocket than
his own. The art of appropriating in the public eye
credit to which he was not in the least entitled,
was one of which he was a past master; it was one
the value of which his father, who certainly neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
any efforts to make himself personally popular,
somewhat underrated. Thrift is a virtue; for
Henry VII., a particularly necessary virtue; but
it is not one that under any circumstances helps to
make him who exercises it attractive. When it assumes
a sordid aspect, it becomes definitely repellent.</p>

<p>That did not trouble Henry; he wanted money,
and during the greater part of his reign he got it
without flagrant extortion; with such success, too,
that in his later years he was able almost entirely
to work without calling Parliament: the skill with
which he conducted his foreign negotiations on the
same cash principles contributing not a little to this
result.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY</span></h3>

<p>It was characteristic of Henry, and somewhat unfortunate
for his reputation, that he cared nothing
at all about investing his policy with any showiness
unless some specific end was to be gained thereby.
The objects his government had in view were essentially
prosaic: commonplace they cannot be called,
because in a mediæval monarch they were eminently
original. It was customary for kings to interfere
in commercial affairs chiefly when they saw their
way to collect by so doing contributions to the
exchequer, or when it seemed worth while to make
enactments in favour of capital as against labour.
Henry has the credit of being the first English king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
who clearly recognised commercial development as
a primary care of government: which hitherto only
the oligarchical city-states of Italy and the German
free-towns had done. It is true that he was quite
ready to subordinate the commercial to a political
end; to attack those who sheltered his enemies,
not with pikes and culverins but with commercial
restrictions only less injurious to English trade than
to that of the antagonist. He did so without suffering
from the illusion that the loss of the foreign
merchant was the gain of the English. In these
cases he weighed the economic loss against the
political gain. In mediæval practice, the economic
consideration would have counted for practically
nothing in the scale. In the eyes of some politicians
to-day, no political advantage would be worth
counting as against an economic inconvenience&mdash;and
it is usually extremely difficult to show that a
political advantage will accompany an economic
inconvenience. But Henry was only just emerging
from mediæval conceptions. The remarkable thing
is that he realised commerce as an object of policy
at all, not that he rated its importance lower than
Adam Smith: that he relaxed the mediæval theory,
not that he did not discard it altogether.</p>

<p>This argument is not to be misunderstood. It
has nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness
of any economic theory, but only with the place of
economics in the whole scheme of government.
Henry thought it worth while, as every king before
him would have done, almost to cut off England
from her best market for her most paying product,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
wool, if he could thereby force the archduke’s
government to withdraw its effective countenance
from Perkin Warbeck. But he made it a constant
object of his policy to negotiate the opening of fresh
markets for that commodity, and when he came to
terms with the archduke, the commercial benefits
to be secured by the treaty known as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Intercursus
Magnus</i> were his first care.</p>

<p>As Henry was the first to give commercial considerations
a leading place in his system, so he is to be
distinguished for the attention he gave to shipping;
on which head Bacon has a rather remarkable note,
to the effect that he deserves praise for perceiving
that in this instance it was worth while to diminish
commerce for the sake of developing the marine&mdash;to
subordinate the economic loss to the political
gain. If Bacon read Henry’s mind aright, he was
not under the delusion that the protection of English
shipping interests by his successive Navigation Acts
was of direct economic advantage; but he did see
that it was worth while to pay the price in order to
give England such a mercantile navy as in Bacon’s
own day enabled her to win the supremacy of the
seas. Those Acts, restricting the importation of
foreign goods to English ships, raised the price of
imports without benefiting any English industry at
all except that of the shippers; but the impetus
given to shipping provided the country with a
fighting force at sea which ultimately enabled her
to challenge the might of Spain. The naval development
of England was the work of the Tudor dynasty,
though Edward I., Edward III., and Henry V.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
had ideas. Whether the Navigation Acts really did
give the impetus attributed to them&mdash;as to which
economists may dispute&mdash;the intention is unmistakable,
and the foresight which deliberately set up
naval development as an end to be pursued is a
very clear mark of Henry’s statesmanship. The
creation of the English navy is generally credited
either to King Alfred or to Henry VIII.; but
the latter certainly inherited the conception from
his father.</p>

<p>It is matter for regret, but hardly for reproach,
that the king did not apply his ideas of maritime
expansion more actively in another field, that of
oceanic exploration. Portugal and Spain were
allowed to take the lead. Yet it was so well known
that the English king was favourable to such
enterprises that it appears only to have been an
accident which placed Christopher Columbus in the
service of Ferdinand and Isabella instead of in
Henry’s. How history might have been affected
if the West Indies had fallen in the first instance
to England instead of to Spain, is an interesting
subject of speculation. But Spain won the prize.
The sailors who put out from Bristol port tried their
chance in more northerly latitudes; the territories
they discovered were very unpromising; and after
the outset the Genoese (or Venetian) Cabots, sailing
in command of English crews, naturally enough got
little support from the king. But at the outset&mdash;that
is, before it seemed probable if not certain that
Spain and Portugal, by right of priority backed by
a Papal Bull, had, so to speak, staked out a claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to all that was worth having&mdash;Henry gave material
encouragement to the exploring spirit.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, one important economic
problem&mdash;with concomitants&mdash;at grappling with
which no serious attempt was made. This was the
growing agricultural depression: due in part to
legitimate and in part to illegitimate action on the
part of landowners. There was a very large demand
for English wool for foreign looms. Sheep-breeding
was seen to be highly lucrative, whereas tillage was
not. The landowner saw no sufficient reason why
he should be called upon to provide employment
for a quantity of labour which brought him in a small
return, when the employment of a very little labour
over the same area would bring him a large return.
Therefore he converted his arable lands into pasture
for sheep. Economic history abounds in cases of
the displacement of labour by the decay, temporary
or permanent, of some industry which is ceasing
to be lucrative: it abounds also with examples of
legislative attempts to maintain the decaying industries,
and to compel some one or other to provide
employment for the displaced labour. Such attempts
appear to be doomed to failure. No remedy has
yet been found except the development of fresh
industries which in course of time absorb that displaced
labour. Even in the twentieth century,
that is a process which might take years to accomplish;
in the period which we are considering, the
rural displacement took a century to remedy.
Political altruists, like More or Somerset, tried to set
legislation to work, but with the usual want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
success. The encouragement of commercial enterprise
which begets new industries was the only hopeful
direction to work in, and to that Henry’s policy
tended; but it was not till Elizabeth’s government
pursued the same policy that the industrial situation
was appreciably affected. Legislation did a little
towards checking the rapidity with which small
holdings were being absorbed into great estates,
and great estates were being converted into sheep-runs,
but it never amounted to more than a very
feeble brake. The problem is one which still awaits
a satisfactory solution.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">JUDICATURE</span></h3>

<p>Bacon enumerates with applause a variety of good
laws enacted by Henry. He was not in fact remarkable
as a legislator, but his modifications of
the law were all save one in the nature of removal
of abuses. There are, however, two of his enactments
which demand special attention. The first of
these was the Act of 1487, which gave statutory
recognition to judicial functions which had for some
time been exercised by the Privy Council or a committee
thereof, sitting in a room known as the Star
Chamber. In later days, this Court of Star Chamber
was perverted into an instrument of tyranny; in
Henry’s time, it was the only judicial body which
was out of reach of the fear or suspicion of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
terrorised by a powerful noble. It had come into
being because the Sanction of the ordinary law
was inadequate to deal with barons who chose to
over-ride the law. The Privy Council could make
and enforce its decrees without fear. Under these
conditions, the powers it had assumed were necessary
to the assertion of the royal authority against
offenders who contemned the normal Courts.</p>

<p>Without the confident maintenance of the king’s
authority against such offenders, the recurrence
of the anarchy of the last fifty years would have
constantly threatened; but it is obvious that the
powers needed to that end might be misused for the
ends of tyranny. Yet for more than a century the
Court exercised its functions unmistakably for the
public weal. Henry’s Act is notable, not as creating
the Court, but as formally recognising and regulating
its duties; a sound step, tending to prevent its
abuse, not to introduce its use.</p>

<p>The other Act, however, that of 1495, is not
capable of any such defence. It was abused from
the beginning, and was the great instrument of those
exactions by the notorious Empson and Dudley,
which so stain the record of the latter half of Henry’s
reign. Its repeal was one of the first and most
popular acts of his successor. It is to be remembered,
however, that though Empson and Dudley
were not slow in getting to their evil work, their
grosser activities were exercised in the last decade
of the reign after Cardinal Morton’s decease. Henry
was never generous; but the thrift and “nearness”
of his earlier days took some time in developing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the grasping sordidness of his later years. More
than half his reign had passed before the term
extortionate could be applied to him without exaggeration.
The Act, when it was passed, purported
to be, and probably was, intended to prevent offenders
against the law from escaping justice through lack
of an accuser. It permitted judges to institute in
their own Courts, on information laid by a resident
in the district, proceedings for offences not involving
penalties affecting the life or limb of the guilty party.
Such men as Empson and Dudley, however, had no
difficulty&mdash;with partial if not complete connivance
from the king&mdash;in procuring information which
would enable them under colour of law to impose
extortionate fines for the king’s benefit and incidentally
to extract from the victims very handsome
perquisites for themselves.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">FOREIGN POLICY</span></h3>

<p>The reign of Henry V. had made the English king
as powerful a monarch as any in Europe. The
sixty-three years that intervened between his death
and the accession of Henry VII. saw England lose
her pride of place among the nations. On the other
hand, the attempt of Charles the Bold to create a
central Burgundian kingdom had failed, while,
partly on the wreck of his schemes, Louis XI. had
consolidated the French monarchy, and the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
he left to Charles VIII. required for its completion
only the effective absorption of Brittany. The
union of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of
Ferdinand and Isabella had raised Spain to a new
position, which in like manner lacked but one thing,
the conquest of the Moorish kingdom of Granada,
for its complete establishment. Maximilian, “King
of the Romans,” heir to Austria and practically
heir to the Imperial crown, had strengthened his
own position by marrying the Duchess of Burgundy,
Charles the Bold’s daughter, and thus acquiring a
paramount interest in the wealthy Netherlands.
England, with her internal turmoils and her lost
military prestige, had for the moment lost all weight
in the counsels of Europe. Even had the immediate
termination of civil discord been assured, she was
too much exhausted to recover her place by force
of arms; and as long as there was a Yorkist Pretender
at large, civil discord could not be regarded as
conclusively at an end. Nevertheless, even during
the years while his dynasty was threatened, the
king’s diplomatic skill completely changed the
relations of England and the Continental Powers;
while his policy towards Scotland kept the normal
hostility of the Northern kingdom in check, and
bore ultimate fruit in the union of the crowns, a
century afterwards. He did not, like Wolsey&mdash;his
disciple as far as methods were concerned&mdash;achieve
or aim at a dominant position; but when
English interests were concerned, the voice of
England could not in his later years be neglected,
as at the beginning of the reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
He worked not by exploits in the stricken field
but by diplomacy, therein illustrating his modernity.
He sent armies into Brittany and Picardy, but they
were intended to threaten, not to strike. He found
a kindred spirit in Ferdinand of Aragon: of whom
Louis XII. in later years complained that he had once
cheated him. “He lies,” said Ferdinand, with
pride; “I have cheated him three times.” Ferdinand’s
respect was reserved for Henry, whom he
could not cheat at all, or even out-wit, which is
not quite the same thing. Henry did not cheat&mdash;that
is, he did not break faith; but his engagements
were always so carefully hedged that the smallest
evasion on the part of an ally could be made an adequate
ground for complete evasion on his own. He
could not prevent the absorption of Brittany; but
the French king, as soon as he turned his ambitions
towards Italy, found that Henry could hamper him
so seriously that he willingly bought him off. Maximilian
remained impecunious&mdash;harmless, therefore,
unless he could persuade some one else to finance
him&mdash;since the Netherlands declined to recognise
his authority. As for Ferdinand, Henry fought him
with his own weapons; and evenly matched as they
were, the Englishman did not prove less adept than
the Spaniard. Their first treaty seemed a very one-sided
affair; but Henry in fact won by it that recognition
which was of the first importance to him at
that early stage, while he appeared to render in
return a great deal more than he actually gave. In
1495, the Spanish sovereigns attached so much
value to his alliance that in spite of haggling they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
were obliged next year to concede him his own terms,
which, though not extravagant, were much higher
than they liked, and very much higher than he
would have ventured even to propose six or seven
years earlier. But they could still regard the betrothal
of their daughter Katherine to the Prince
of Wales as something of an act of grace on their part.
Four years later, it is evident that they thought
Henry could better afford to break that marriage
off than they could themselves: and again a little
later, when Prince Arthur died, they were not a
whit less desirous than Henry himself of betrothing
the young widow to the new Prince of Wales. This
restoration of status Henry achieved at the cost of
nothing more than some military parade which was
very much more than recouped out of the French
treasury.</p>

<p>The key to Henry’s success is to be found just in
the fact that the most astute of his rivals was quite
unable to trick him; secondly, in his skilful avoidance
of any measures which committed him to a
position from which he could not retreat without loss
of prestige. His value to Spain lay chiefly in his
ability to hamper France. Presently Spain awoke
to his capacity for restricting the hampering process
precisely within the limits which were convenient
to himself, which might be very much narrower than
suited her. Presently again it appeared that he
might find it still more convenient to join hands with
France, which would minimise the use to be made
of Maximilian. Instead of Henry being in need of
assistance against France, which might be doled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
at the convenience of Spain, Spain had to supply
inducements to keep England on her side. As a
matter of fact, Henry to the last needed Ferdinand
quite as much as Ferdinand needed him, but succeeded
in giving a different impression.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p>Our survey so far seems to show conclusively that
for some two-thirds of his reign Henry conducted
the business which had devolved upon him not only
with remarkable practical success but without at
all justifying the sinister impression of his character
which is indubitably prevalent. Yet, even without
the record of his later years, as to which something
remains to be said, this unattractive impression is
not unnatural. We feel that a great ruler of a great
nation ought to have something about him, majestic,
splendid, heroic. We even forgive a man for evil
deeds done in a grand style; we do not feel our
admiration stirred even by good deeds done in a
pedestrian style. Magnanimity loses its flavour
when we scent policy in it. We are offended with a
king who is not kingly, and kingliness demands those
Aristotelian virtues which are generally rendered
as Magnanimity and Magnificence. They are attributes
in which the seventh Henry is conspicuously
deficient.</p>

<p>A phrase at the beginning of the foregoing paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
was employed with definite intention. Henry
treated kingship as a business. He entered upon
it very much as a new managing director might enter
upon the conduct of a great concern which demands
re-organisation. He knows that the retention of his
position depends on his successfulness; that success
is possible only if he has a free hand, while his board
likes to think that it is exercising the real control.
He has to establish confidence in himself within, and
to re-establish confidence in the house without.
He avoids palpable injustice; no one can call him
dishonest; he knows exactly how far he can trust
clients, and rely on the co-operation of other establishments
in a joint policy; and he makes that
business a distinct success&mdash;but he is not very likely
to make himself personally popular, or in any sense
an object of enthusiasm. For that, something is
needed over and above a strict and capable attention
to business; and the something over and above was
wanting in Henry Tudor. In keenness of intelligence,
he was more than a match for the most astute
of living statesmen. The general rectitude of his
aims was commendable; the moderation of his
methods was meritorious. He did good service to
the nation over which he ruled. He was not cruel;
he was not capricious; he was never guided by
prejudice or passion; but he remains hopelessly
and irredeemably unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Yet had he died within a year or two of his best
minister, his portion would have been cold praise,
but still praise. He outlived Morton by nearly nine
years, whose baleful shadow is over his whole career,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
turning a negative into a positive dislike. For in
those years every baser quality of which there is
any hint in the earlier days becomes intensified.</p>

<p>He had always treated marriage primarily as an
affair of politics, as was natural and inevitable, but
with a sufficient respect for its moral aspects to keep
him faithful to his own wife. Yet when his son
died, the idea of joining the widow to his second son
had for him none of that repulsion which it excited
almost universally in his day. It is even said that
when his own queen died he contemplated marrying
Katherine himself. It is quite certain that he
contemplated marrying Katherine’s sister Joanna
of Castile, although he knew her to be mentally
deranged. His economy degenerated into niggardliness;
his politic scheming to fill his treasury
developed into a griping greed for gold. Empson
and Dudley carried on their nefarious work of
extortion with his knowledge and sanction. He
grew vindictive, and when Thomas More opposed
a subsidy in the Parliament of 1504, he sought an
excuse for fining the father, and the “beardless
boy” himself had to retire into private life, lest a
worse thing should befall him. He had always
considered himself at liberty to break the spirit of
a promise provided that he kept the letter; but,
if tradition does not wrong him, when the Earl of
Suffolk was surrendered on promise that he would
not put him to death, he took care to suggest to the
Prince of Wales that the promise would not bind his
heir when his time came.</p>

<p>The man revealed to us in these later years is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
ugly, sordid, very unlovely. But this man does not
truly or fairly present to us the real Henry who
restored order in England, and recovered for her a
respectable position among the nations; holding his
own in a singularly difficult situation and keeping
at bay the onslaughts of an embittered faction at
the cost of a quite astonishingly small amount of
bloodshed, and with the minimum of anything that
could reasonably be called injustice towards antagonists.
This at least England owes to him, that he
did more than any of his predecessors to lay the
foundations of her commercial greatness; that he
recognised more clearly than any of them the benefit
of her maritime development.</p>

<p>The man moreover was not altogether lacking
in some finer qualities which seem to have withered
when his degeneration set in. He who seems almost
an incarnation of chill-blooded, unemotional craftiness
was capable of very human and very tender
feeling. A record from the hand of an anonymous
contemporary, when his son Arthur died, has been
transcribed before, and is worth transcribing again.</p>

<p>“In the year of our Lord God 1502, the second
day of April, in the castle of Ludlow, deceased Prince
Arthur, first begotten son of our sovereign Lord,
King Henry the Seventh, and in the 17th year of
his reign. Immediately after his death Sir Richard
Poole his Chamberlain, with other of his Council,
wrote and sent letters to the King and Council to
Greenwich, where his Grace and the Queen’s lay,
and certified them of the Prince’s departure. The
which Council discreetly sent for the King’s ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
father, a friar observant, to whom they showed this
most sorrowful and heavy tidings, and desired him
in his best manner to show it to the King. He in
the morning of the Tuesday following, and somewhat
before the time accustomed, knocked at the
King’s chamber door; and when the King understood
that it was his Confessor, he commanded to
let him in. The Confessor then commanded all
those there present to avoid, and after one salutation
began to say <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si bona de Manu Domini suscipimus,
mala autem quare non sustineamus?</i> and
so showed his Grace that his dearest son was departed
to God. When his Grace understood that sorrowful
heavy tidings he sent for the Queen, saying that he
and his Queen would take the painful sorrows together.
After that she was come, and saw the King
her lord and that natural and painful sorrow, as I
have heard say, she with full great and constant
comfortable words, besought his Grace that he
would, first after God, remember the weal of his own
noble person, the comfort of his realm and of her.
She then said that my lady his mother had never
no more children but him only, and that God by
his grace had ever preserved him and brought him
where that he was; over that, how that God had
left him yet a fair prince, two fair princesses; and
that God is where he was, and we are both young
enough; and that the prudence and wisdom of his
Grace sprung over all Christendom, so that it should
please him to take this accordingly thereunto. Then
the King thanked her of her good comfort. After
that she was departed and come to her own chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
natural and motherly loss smote her so sorrowful
to the heart, that those that were about her were fain
to send for the King to comfort her. Then his
Grace, of true, gentle, and faithful love, in good haste
came and relieved her, and showed her how wise
counsel she had given him before; and he for his part
would thank God for his son, and would she should
do in like wise.”</p>

<p>That story, obviously derived from an actual
witness, gives a fine impression of Elizabeth; but
it no less obviously implies a very genuine affection
subsisting between her and Henry, and a very sincere
devotion in both to their son. Henry, however,
was by nature a reserved and somewhat lonely man,
and Elizabeth’s death not long after deprived him
of the last softening influence. His whole life had
been a tremendous strain. His boyhood and early
manhood aged him prematurely. From the day
that he landed in England to wrest the sceptre from
Richard, the strain had never relaxed; the bow had
never been slackened. At five-and-forty, he may
well have been as much worn out as are men less
severely tried twenty-five years later in life. The
work he had to do was anything but inspiriting;
he did it with dogged patience. The task was thankless,
and he got little thanks. It was accomplished
ungraciously, and he receives no grace in return.
A dreary life, and a dreary reign; yet the reign is
not without admirable qualities, nor the life without
gleams of nobility.</p>

</div>

<p>In these words, Shakespeare or another has summed
up the character of the great Cardinal as it presented
itself to his enemies. As Katharine painted him,
posterity has for the most part regarded him. Men
who have risen from the ranks, and in their prosperity
assume the state and splendour appropriate
to hereditary position, are rarely popular. When
they are so, it is because they have identified their
names in some sort with popular causes. Of all the
statesmen who for a long term of years controlled
or seemed to control the destinies of England, not
one perhaps has found apologists so few as Thomas
Wolsey.</p>

<p>Of recent years, however, there has been a change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
It has hardly yet made its way into popular accounts;
but the attitude of serious historians has been at
least largely modified by the publication of the State
Papers under the editorship of the late Dr. Brewer,
and of his Introductions to those volumes. The
doctrine used to be that Wolsey was a man of exceeding
arrogance who acquired a pernicious mastery
over the mind of Henry VIII., and whose political
achievement consisted mainly in a miserably fruitless
meddling with foreign affairs in which England had
no concern, dictated by an insatiable ambition for
the Papal crown. Whereas Dr. Brewer and Bishop
Creighton after him have laid it down that Wolsey
raised England from the position of a third or fourth-rate
Power to an equality with the greatest nations
in Europe.</p>

<p>During the years of his power, it is at least clear
that Wolsey did achieve for England such a position
among the nations as she had not held, at any rate
since the days of Henry V.; and that he did this,
not, like Henry V., by aggressive militarism, but
by diplomatic skill: that he sought to be, and to a
great extent succeeded in being, the pacificator of
Europe as well as the aggrandiser of England. In
his aim and method, however, he followed in the footsteps
of Henry VII., and his policy was a natural
development, though a vast extension, of that laid
down by that astute monarch. And in the second
aspect of his policy, he was again developing that
of the old king, in striving to make the power of the
Crown independent alike of the old nobility and of
Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
But a recent <span class="locked">biographer<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span> has ventured so far as
to declare that “Wolsey stands out as the greatest
statesman England has ever produced; and it is
not going beyond what records reveal if we say his
was the master-mind of his age”&mdash;the age of Erasmus
and Luther.</p>

<p>That is unfortunately a species of criticism which
excites the spirit of hostility. Wolsey was of that
type of politicians, rare in England, who have made
foreign affairs their first interest: also he was, what
probably no other Englishman ever has been, beyond
all comparison the ablest diplomatist among his
contemporaries. Diplomacy is a field in which the
reputation of England does not stand high. But
one asks at once&mdash;What in fact did his diplomacy
achieve? And, diplomacy apart, the great upheaval
which issued in the Reformation was in full
activity when Wolsey was at the height of his power
and influence. The master-mind of his age therefore
could hardly have failed to leave his mark on
the Reformation. What did Wolsey accomplish&mdash;nay,
what did he even attempt to accomplish&mdash;in
that connexion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">CARDINALIS PACIFICATOR</span></h3>

<p>Thomas Wolsey was born probably in 1471. His
father was a citizen of Norwich&mdash;a grazier. The
popular voice calls him a butcher. The boy was
sent very young to Oxford, taking his degree when
he was only fourteen years old, and otherwise achieving
high distinction. At Magdalen he remained,
fulfilling various college functions till the end of
1499. Before that date, John Colet, five years his
senior, had commenced his famous course of lectures,
introducing a new style of scholarship and a new type
of biblical criticism. Thomas More, seven years his
junior, had finished his University career. Erasmus
had paid Oxford a flying visit. There is no trace of
any personal association between Wolsey and these
lights of the new school: yet there is no doubt
whatever that as an educationist he was in close
sympathy with them. The facts are therefore the
more significant of some incompatibility of temperament:
for we should naturally have expected
scholars, agreed upon an innovating theory, to have
been drawn together.</p>

<p>Acting at this time in a tutorial capacity to the
sons of the Marquess of Dorset, Wolsey was rewarded
by a living at Limington: and the ex-bursar of
Magdalen was in a very short time a quite notable
pluralist, and in close personal relations with various
important personages, culminating in his appointment
as Chaplain to Henry VII. in 1506. The king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
whose only living rival in diplomatic astuteness was
Ferdinand of Spain, was prompt to discern the
kindred abilities of his new servant, who within a
year or two was successfully employed to carry
through important negotiations both in Flanders
and in Scotland.</p>

<p>In April 1509 the old king died. His successor
was hailed with acclamation on all hands. Of
splendid physique, and glowing with martial ardour
as was natural in a healthy boy of eighteen, the
military section of society saw in him promise of a
revival of the glories of Agincourt. The scholars
too claimed their part in him, as he joyously claimed
fellowship with them. The populace shouted applause
when the detested Empson and Dudley were
sent to the block. The veterans who occupied the
chief thrones of Europe dreamed that the innocent
youth would be to them as clay in the hands of the
potter. Every one was satisfied.</p>

<p>For a little while all went merrily. The English
nobles thirsted for war with France: Ferdinand and
Maximilian had no difficulty in persuading the young
monarch that in alliance with them he might achieve
the laurels for which he hankered. He was to begin
the fighting, they were to play at supporting him,
and if by good luck something more substantial
than laurels should be achieved, that of course would
go to his partners.</p>

<p>Wolsey’s old pupil the Marquess of Dorset was
sent to Spain in command of the expedition which
was to begin the war, with the conquest of Guienne
in view. Dorset’s army wanted beer: they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
only get wine, which they considered thin. In effect
they went on strike, and insisted on coming home
again. The marquess brought them back ignominiously,
without so much as a laurel-leaf.</p>

<p>Fox, Bishop of Winchester, perhaps the best of
the old king’s surviving ministers, had been pressed
into the background by the warlike nobles; but
he had succeeded in introducing into the Council
the man who was to sweep the nobles themselves
into the background. Wolsey was nobody in particular,
but he was a very clever man with immense
organising ability and an infinite capacity for detail
and for hard work. The fiasco was not repeated.
In 1513, the army of invasion went to its proper
field, Picardy. It was not a haphazard picnic
party, and it captured Terouenne and Tournai.
In the meantime, Surrey was shattering the Scots
army at Flodden. A few months later, Henry had
discovered that Ferdinand and Maximilian were
using him as a cat’s-paw. Again a few months
passed, and Wolsey had beaten them at their own
game. France and England were in alliance. Then
the uncontrollable changed the face of things. King
Louis died: Francis I. succeeded. But the brief
dream of the old kings had been finally dissipated:
Henry was going to be nobody’s cats-paw. He had
found a minister more than worthy to follow in his
father’s footsteps.</p>

<p>In 1515 Wolsey was fully established not as the
king’s chief adviser, but in effect as his sole minister.
In 1513 he was not yet guiding the king’s policy:
his work was mainly administrative. In 1514 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
distinctive principle of his policy comes into full
play. The anti-Gallic theory is discarded. Thenceforth,
the hand of England is not against any Power
in particular. As Foreign Minister, Wolsey’s business
is to see that the balance of power is maintained;
that no one prince shall be too far aggrandised;
that each of them shall be a check on the aggression
of others; that all shall maintain a habitual attitude
of concession to England for the sake of her support;
and that this is to be effected without involving
England in actual warfare. Ferdinand dies in
1516; Maximilian in 1519. Charles V. succeeds
both to Spain and to the Empire. In the latter
year, the destinies of Europe are in the hands of
three monarchs not one of whom is thirty years old.
Wolsey during the following years remains in effect
the arbiter of Europe till his hand is forced by Henry,
and he finds himself compelled to overt hostility
with France. After the disaster of Pavia, the blunder
becomes manifest; his own policy is again allowed
free play, and the old domination is all but recovered
when the affair of the divorce wipes all other questions
out of the field. The king’s will must be
carried out at all costs. Failing therein, the Cardinal
falls&mdash;irretrievably.</p>

<p>Two leading facts emerge. First: so long as
Wolsey is allowed a free hand to carry out his own
policy, he does it with complete success. Second:
if the king elects to lay down a different policy, the
Cardinal has to carry that policy through as best
he may. The idea that he ruled the king is entirely
fallacious. For some years, the king had the wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
to recognise that his minister’s views were sound.
Then his anti-Gallic leanings dominated him. Then
he perceived his error, and reverted to his minister’s
policy; till again a purely personal motive intervened,
and policy again went to the winds. Since
the personal motive could not be satisfied without
a revolution, Henry conducted the revolution himself.
The <i>rôle</i> the king required of his minister
was one demanding other abilities than those of the
Cardinal, and the Cardinal was thrown to the wolves.</p>

<p>Effectively then it is true to say that while Wolsey
held sway in England, he was the arbiter of Europe.
Whether it was for the good of England that she
should concern herself with being the arbiter of
Europe is another matter. It may be argued that
the less she has to do with Europe the better for her.
But the theory of splendid isolation for Great Britain
is not the same thing as that theory applied to
England when Scotland was an independent nation
in habitual alliance with France, and always ready
for hostilities. Even after Flodden the menace on
the Northern Border had to be taken into perpetual
count. Moreover, the advocates of that doctrine
must still recognise that the opposite view is legitimately
maintainable; and it follows that the statesman
who, acting on the opposite view, successfully
upheld English predominance without plunging the
country into sanguinary wars, is entitled to a very
high meed of praise.</p>

<p>Yet this does not express the whole of Wolsey’s
achievement: for, when he began to guide England’s
policy, he had to win position for her, not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
to maintain a position already held&mdash;a hard enough
task in itself. To say that she was no more than a
third or fourth-rate Power is an exaggeration. It
was true in 1485: it had ceased to be true in 1500.
Long before the close of his reign, the first Tudor
had made himself a person of very considerable
importance, whom none of the continental Powers
dreamed of ignoring, and with whom they treated
on something very like equal terms. This, however,
was in no small degree a matter of personal prestige.
Henry’s reputation for astuteness stood so high,
not to speak of his credit for accumulated wealth,
that the Courts of the continent paid England’s king
an amount of respect which they would not have
rendered to the power of England. With the removal
of his personality, England dropped to a
lower plane, but certainly did not become a negligeable
quantity. If there was a brief disposition to
regard her not as negligeable but as futile, that was
due merely to the hastily formed conclusion that the
young king was a tender innocent. The old Henry’s
position was recovered the moment that Wolsey’s
abilities were recognised. The marriage of the young
princess Mary to the old King of France in 1514,
was precisely the kind of stroke which Henry VII.
would have made. It marked the fact that in any
leagues or combinations which foreign princes might
contemplate, an England thoroughly alive to her
own interests, and thoroughly capable of safe-guarding
them, must be reckoned with. In producing this
result, Wolsey’s administrative ability as well as
his diplomatic skill had played no small part; since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to that was owing, in a great degree, the successes
which attended the English arms in 1513; successes
which were effective reminders that what English
troops had done before they might learn to do again.</p>

<p>So far, however, what Wolsey had done was little
if at all more than to restore the position of 1508;
though this was accompanied by a suggestion that
English interference in Continental affairs might be
of a less purely defensive order than it had been
under the late king. The suggestion was very soon
to be turned into fact; and for some years kings
and emperors and popes were to find that, whatever
designs they might have in hand, they would
have no chance of carrying them out beyond the
point which Wolsey might be induced to sanction.
The distinguishing feature of Wolsey’s method was
his reliance on purely diplomatic action, to which
end he had the aid of a particularly capable subordinate
in Richard Pace. The Cardinal habitually
posed as an arbitrator, composing the differences
of Christendom and maintaining that general peace
which it was theoretically the special function of
the Roman Pontiff to secure.</p>

<p>For Ferdinand of Aragon, the leading idea was
always to find an ally who could be inveigled into
doing his fighting for him without any return. For
Maximilian, the leading idea was to find an ally who
would subsidise him to do the fighting while he could
evade his own part of the bargain. Wolsey, by his
alliance with Louis XII., turned the tables on both
of them. The alliance itself was practically terminated
by the accession of Francis in January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
1515. France reaped the immediate profit, for
neither Spain nor the emperor would risk a course
which depended for success on a mutual fulfilment
of obligations. Ferdinand became friendly to
Francis, but without any intention of giving him
effective support. When the latter’s progress in
Italy seemed likely to be too rapid, Wolsey entered
into relations with Maximilian which served as a
check on Francis without filling the emperor’s
purse. When Ferdinand died, Charles, his successor,
was only sixteen, and though his counsellors were
well disposed to France, being mainly Flemings,
there was no present prospect of vigorous intervention
on his behalf. Active hostility on the part of
England would be dangerous, and when Maximilian
in turn died, both Charles and Francis were suitors
for the favour of the supreme minister in England.
The turn of the wheel had made them inevitable
rivals. The imperial election went in favour of
Charles, that being less dangerous than the success
of Francis would have been, and it was now Wolsey’s
policy to hold the balance between the two. An
era of universal peace was inaugurated; Charles
and Francis did not join in formal alliance, but
England united with each of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">WOLSEY AND THE FRENCH WAR</span></h3>

<p>The inauguration of an era of universal peace is
usually the prelude to a war. A year after the Field
of the Cloth of Gold, Charles and Francis were on
the verge of hostilities. Wolsey negotiated with
both, ostensibly to bring about an accord. But in
fact, England was committed to support Charles:
and the responsibility was with the Cardinal.</p>

<p>The conclusion to which the circumstances point
is that the pressure was too great for him to resist.
Popular sentiment in England was opposed to the
French alliance. The queen was a warm adherent
of her young kinsman. The king was personally
jealous of the achievements of Francis, and had
visions of the French crown or at least of the recovery
of Guienne. Wolsey probably felt that if he
tried to maintain his own policy he would alienate
Henry, and if he alienated Henry&mdash;who had just
annihilated Buckingham&mdash;he would meet Buckingham’s
fate amid universal applause, and the anti-French
policy would triumph in any case. He
elected to carry out the anti-French policy and remain
at the helm. Hostile critics would suggest that he
was actuated by the desire of obtaining the support
of the emperor when the Papacy should become
vacant. Charles failed to keep his promise when
Leo died, and gave his support to another candidate;
but neither then nor in the following year when
Clement VII. was elected&mdash;again with the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of Charles&mdash;did Wolsey show any sign of changing
his policy in consequence.</p>

<p>The English people had wanted the war; when
they got it they paid for it at first cheerfully. But
no advantage accrued, not even appreciable glory,
and they tired of it. After Pavia, Henry thought
the opportunity had come to strike for the French
crown; but such an effort demanded more money.
The business of getting it of course devolved on the
Cardinal. There was no hope of obtaining it legitimately
from a Parliament; Wolsey tried illegitimate
methods&mdash;and failed. There was no alternative
but to drop the war policy. Wolsey made an advantageous
peace, and Charles promptly found
himself obliged to come to terms with Francis. But
it is clear that from this moment Wolsey’s position
with his master became painfully uncertain.</p>

<p>Here then is the practical termination of Wolsey’s
great period. After this, the king is absorbed by
the divorce, and the minister, willy-nilly, must
devote himself to that object&mdash;his own ruin being
the alternative. His diplomatic labours achieved
no permanent result, because the position won for
England could only be maintained by continuity
of diplomatic effort and diplomatic skill. After her
own very different fashion, Elizabeth fifty years
later was balancing continental forces, and manipulating
them to her own ends, in a manner much less
impressive and often indeed singularly undignified,
but certainly not less successful. And with her,
the result was that the England which Philip of
Spain had hoped to make an appanage of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
established herself as the indisputable mistress of
the seas. The change in the relative position of
England between 1558 and 1588 was far greater
than between 1508 and 1528.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth worked with a perfectly free hand.
Wolsey worked for a master, who was quite capable
of wrecking the minister’s schemes for a purely
personal end. He had to persuade that master
to sanction a policy which he never adopted with
enthusiasm. He had to carry it through in spite
of the hostility of the governing classes, the ill-will
of the queen&mdash;who was still on terms of accord with
her husband&mdash;and his own extreme unpopularity
with the mob. That is, he had to work single-handed
amidst extremely adverse conditions; and
all the circumstances being taken together, it may
fairly be said that he displayed a diplomatic genius
unique among English statesmen.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">DOMESTIC POLICY</span></h3>

<p>In the field of foreign affairs Wolsey’s policy and
his methods were both derived from Henry VII.: or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say he applied
the same methods to a development of the same
policy. The invaluable make-weight was converted
into the inevitable arbiter: the means, a process
of peaceful bargain-driving. The bargains were
usually in both cases profitable for England. Incidentally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
they generally contained unwritten
clauses which were profitable also to the Cardinal.
There is no reason to suppose that any case occurred
in which Wolsey permitted essentials to be in the
slightest degree affected by considerations of his own
gain. But he himself would never have thought
of disputing that he accumulated great profits out
of his diplomatic transactions.</p>

<p>The first objective then of Wolsey’s policy was
the establishment of England not merely as an
important factor but as the dominant factor in
European politics: therein going beyond anything
that Henry VII. had contemplated, but still acting
on lines laid down by him. In his second objective,
he was still a disciple of the old king. This
was the establishment of the Crown as a practical
autocracy.</p>

<p>The primary condition of an absolutist government
was a full treasury; and here Wolsey had the
immense advantage of the great hoards accumulated
during the last reign. In spite of the heavy expenditure
involved in ministering to the king’s pleasures,
and on such pageantry as the Field of the Cloth of
Gold, government in Wolsey’s hands was economically
conducted. The great revenues which fell
into his own hands not merely from the numerous
preferments he held in England, but also from
foreign sources, enabled him to defray the magnificence
of his own establishment, public as well as
private: and there were indirect methods of throwing
much of the cost of the Court upon private
persons. It was not till 1523 that the Cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
found himself forced to look to the country for
supplies by the necessities of a war budget. For
very nearly ten years he had carried on the government
without calling Parliament, although it had
hardly been summoned during the preceding decade;
under a continuance of the same <i>régime</i>, England
might have become accustomed to doing almost
without Parliament.</p>

<p>The second principle in establishing absolutism
was the further depression of the nobility, who&mdash;again,
as in the days of Henry VII.&mdash;were steadily
kept from offices of State. Even the Howards
exercised no control; and the most powerful of all,
the Duke of Buckingham, was suddenly brought
to the block. In that, as in everything the king
did that was unpopular, the minister was charged
with being the moving spirit, and his determination
to destroy all rivals was accounted the moving cause.
As a matter of fact, the duke’s execution fitted in
with the Cardinal’s policy: but there is no direct
ground for supposing that he had any active share
in the matter. On the whole, there is no evidence
that he was particularly vindictive. Still, personal
ambition apart, since none of the nobles would
willingly have been associated with him as a colleague
it was necessary to the carrying out of his policy
that his rivals should have their talons pared as far
as possible; and also of course that there should be
none powerful enough to form a disaffected party.
Wolsey knew that, except for one or two ecclesiastics
who had already in effect retired from the political
arena, he stood practically alone. He had to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
himself necessary to the king, and, since he could
not be loved by the nobles, it undoubtedly suited
him that they should fear him. In the result he
succeeded so completely in destroying all possibility
of opposition to Henry’s will that there was no man
in the kingdom whom the king could not destroy if
he chose merely to raise a finger.</p>

<p>Successful as he was in building up the power of
the Crown, he was still apparently at the height of
his own influence when he learnt that the power of
the purse still lay elsewhere; and the king learnt
a very important lesson at the same time&mdash;a lesson
which he was to turn to account before very long&mdash;the
importance of conciliating popular sentiment.
Money was needed for the French war. Wolsey
would have treated the Parliament, called to provide
it, as a mere passive instrument for carrying out the
royal behest. Had the House of Commons in 1523
suffered itself to be brow-beaten, it would have
virtually surrendered its place in the Constitution.
The House refused to be brow-beaten: it refused
point-blank to discuss or to vote in the Cardinal’s
presence. When he retired in wrath, a substantial
sum was voted, but as a free grant to the king, not
obligatory. Two years later, more money was
wanted. Wolsey did not dare to ask a Parliament
for it. He resorted to Benevolences, and found the
citizens of London obstinate in their assertion that
Benevolences were illegal. However willing Parliaments
or burgesses might be to leave measures to
the king and his minister, they were absolutely
determined to provide nothing out of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
pockets unless their own consent had first been
obtained through strictly constitutional channels.</p>

<p>In this thing Henry was quick to prove himself
shrewder than the Cardinal. Like his daughter
after him, he had an intuitive perception of the
national temper, and lost no time in repudiating
the idea of coercion. His personal popularity was
doubled, and all the odium for the attempt fell upon
the minister. But the scheme towards which he
was strongly predisposed had been foiled, and
Wolsey, though the result favoured his own views,
knew that it would be fatal to him if he failed a
second time to give effect to the king’s desires.</p>

<p>Therefore the Cardinal now gave himself up to
the effort to meet his master’s demands in the matter
on which he had set his heart, the separation from
Katharine. But in this one matter, success for him
was sufficiently improbable from the outset, and as
time went on events which he was wholly unable
to control made it a sheer impossibility. He failed,
and the failure spelt his ruin. Giving himself
utterly to the king’s service, his compliance did not
save him. Hitherto he had been a statesman,
pursuing ends which certainly magnified both his
country and his sovereign with extraordinary ability
and amazing success, by methods certainly not
more unscrupulous than were sanctioned by the
universal practice of the time. Now he devoted
himself to an object wholly unworthy, which he
must have felt to be utterly unrighteous. The
king for whom he degraded himself served him&mdash;characteristically.
Did the fallen man feel that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
punishment was just, even while the hand that dealt
it was supremely unjust? It would seem so. The
sentiment, if not the words, which Shakespeare put
in his mouth is authentic:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">O Cromwell, Cromwell!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have left me naked to mine enemies.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE DIVORCE</span></h3>

<p>The whole story of the divorce is an ugly one;
no amount of sophistry will ever make it anything
else. Mr. Froude succeeded in persuading himself
that pure unsullied patriotism was Henry’s ruling
motive: and brings himself, apparently with some
difficulty, to grant a qualified pardon to Katharine
for her resistance, on the ground that after all she
was a woman, and weak. If Henry had acted as
some others have done, and had taken up definitely
the position that by hook or by crook the legalisation
of a new marriage for him was a national necessity,
in order that a male heir to the throne might be
born, the issue would have been a plain one. If
bigamy could be justified on the grounds of national
expediency, there was a decently good case for
authorising a bigamous union. To provide a technical
trick for evading the form of bigamy would no doubt
have made the process easier, not affecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
ethics of it one way or other. But it followed logically
that national interests alone were first to be taken
into consideration in the selection of the new spouse.
The fact that in that choice Henry was guided by
passion and no other consideration whatever is
sufficient proof that the actuating motive with him
was not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">salus populi suprema lex</i>. The grotesque
nemesis by which later on Henry found himself with
three acknowledged children of his body of whom
two were born in what was supposed to be wedlock,
both in virtue of marriages which the Courts had
subsequently declared void, while the third, a boy,
had no pretensions to legitimate birth&mdash;that nemesis
is really a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> of the whole position.</p>

<p>If on the other hand the awakening of Henry’s
conscientious scruples had not coincided with a
violent passion for another woman it would have
been easier to believe that they were genuine, and
that all he really wanted&mdash;as he frequently affirmed&mdash;was
to have those scruples allayed. A genuine
doubt would assuredly have demanded an authoritative
pronouncement. Unfortunately, he made it
perfectly clear that no authority could allay the
scruples; he was absolutely determined that the
Pope and the Cardinal between them must see to
it that the doubts should be confirmed.</p>

<p>The precise stage at which Henry discovered that
the weal of his people required a male heir of his
body at any cost; at which his conscience began to
question the validity of the dispensation under which
he had married Katharine; at which he determined
that Anne Boleyn should supplant the queen: all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
these are matter of some doubt. It is fairly clear
that in 1526&mdash;certainly in 1527&mdash;if not before, Wolsey
had been made aware that the king was desirous of
exchanging Katharine for Anne; that Wolsey on
his knees entreated the king to think better of it;
that he found the king obdurate. There is no sign
at all that the ethics of the divorce troubled Wolsey
in any way; on the other hand no one has ever
questioned that the Boleyn marriage was a thing
hateful to him from every point of view. But he
had to choose between lending himself to the king’s
desire and rushing on his own ruin. Perhaps there
are not many men who would have dared to take
the nobler course; Wolsey, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">deteriora secutus</i>, none
the less fell.</p>

<p>It would seem that Wolsey first set himself to
discover some legal expedient for nullifying the
marriage, hit upon the idea that the dispensation
granted by Julius was invalid, and tried more than
one scheme with a view to its being pronounced
invalid&mdash;hoping, it may be, that the law’s delays
would give the king time to get over his infatuation
for Anne, and that when&mdash;if ever&mdash;he should be
legally free to take a new wife, the new wife would be
a more fitting person.</p>

<p>First of all then, Wolsey, as Papal Legate, took
steps for holding a Legatine Court in England before
which the issue should be tried. But this plan
contained a material flaw. Katharine might appeal
to the Pope against the decision of the Legatine
Court, and Wolsey, in the event of such appeal,
would become a mere party in the suit instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
judge. The Pope therefore must be induced either
to give a favourable pronouncement on his own
account, or to appoint a Legatine Court <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad hoc</i>&mdash;a
Court whose judgment would be final. A very
difficult matter; for precisely at this time the recent
misfortunes of France were bearing their fruit:
the emperor became entirely predominant in Italy,
and obtained complete control of Clement&mdash;and the
emperor was Katharine’s most affectionate nephew.
So the hapless Pope, who was very anxious to keep
friends with Henry but was naturally even more
anxious not to offend Charles, desired above everything
to evade giving a decision himself. On the
other hand, Wolsey felt that there must be no
pretext for subsequently questioning the legality
of the process by which the dispensation was to be
quashed, and therefore it was imperative that in
form that process should convey the Papal sanction.
Besides this, he had a very powerful personal reason
for insisting on it. In England the Boleyn connection,
who knew perfectly well what were Wolsey’s views
about Anne, were working hard and not without
success to destroy the king’s trust in the Cardinal,
who saw his influence tottering. Failure to procure
the divorce would certainly mean for him destruction;
success, followed by the Boleyn marriage,
would place more power in the hands of the most
hostile faction, and he would be left absolutely alone
to bear the whole obloquy of an extremely unpopular
measure, unless the ultimate responsibility could be
forced on the reluctant Pope.</p>

<p>As far as Wolsey was concerned, Clement won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the game after apparently yielding. A Legatine
Commission was appointed, but Campeggio was
associated with Wolsey as judge: he managed to
spend the best part of a year in reaching England;
it was in fact fifteen months after the appointment
that the Court began its sittings. A few weeks
later, the Pope revoked the case to Rome. For
all practical purposes, the revocation sealed the
Cardinal’s fate.</p>

<p>For two years past Wolsey’s position, for all that
it seemed to the world so assured, had been extremely
precarious. The king had sent one agent to Rome
behind his minister’s back. The agent’s mission
failed ignominiously, but the thing was significant.
Wolsey had gone to France on a diplomatic errand;
on his return, instead of being summoned to a confidential
meeting with the king, he found Anne
Boleyn in the presence. He had been soundly rated
by the king because, in appointing an abbess to
Wilton, he had rejected a most unsuitable <i>protégée</i>
of the Boleyns. He knew the stake for which he
was playing: he can hardly have doubted, from the
beginning of what was called “The King’s Affair,”
that his fate was bound up with success or failure.
The illusion that he ruled the king was one from
which it does not appear that he ever suffered himself.
All he did was to rule England and English
policy precisely so long as he retained the personal
favour of the king, and his policy did not clash with
any of the royal predilections.</p>

<p>In this matter of the “divorce,” Wolsey has found
an earnest apologist in Father Taunton. In his view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
it would seem that the Cardinal was justified, because
he believed that there really was a technical flaw
in the form of the dispensation as granted by Pope
Julius: if there was such a flaw, the king was
entitled to the benefit of it: and its existence would
enable the Pope to quash the dispensation, without
so much as raising the question whether the granting
of it at all was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i> for any Pope. Now the
ingenuity of the lawyer who wins his client’s case
on a technical quibble may be admired&mdash;in a way:
the ingenuity of the ecclesiastic, who would have
provided the Pope with a golden bridge for evading
an awkward question, is also to be admired. But
in presenting these grounds for admiration, the last
possibility of a <i>moral</i> defence is given away. Persons
honestly believing that the relation between Henry
and Katharine was by the moral law incestuous,
and could not be otherwise, despite any possible
Papal dispensation, were entitled to urge the dissolution
of their union. But if that relation was not
inherently immoral, and was capable of being
made legal as well, then the barest sense of justice
demanded, that no dubious point of law should
be brought in, in order to engineer a dissolution.</p>

<p>The whole case for Wolsey, according to Father
Taunton, rests precisely on this very dubious point
of law. The dispensation was formally drawn to
make the marriage between Henry and Katharine
lawful even if affinity had been contracted. But
in the ordinary course, as the law stood, a woman
being not married but fully betrothed to a man might
not&mdash;although no actual marriage had taken place&mdash;marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
that man’s brother, her doing so being
against “public honesty.” Since the greater includes
the less, and the whole includes the part, it
would seem obvious that a dispensation covering
the actual marriage <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> covered the pre-contract.
Yet the apologist would have it that the
Cardinal was satisfied to rest the <i>whole</i> case for
nullifying the marriage on the position that the
dispensation was technically invalid because it did
not specifically refer to “public honesty” as well
as to affinity. Such was the contemptible quibble
by which the “master-mind of his age” was prepared
to procure a pronouncement that Katharine
was no wife&mdash;so that the Papacy might escape an
awkward dilemma.</p>

<p>It is at least intelligible to maintain that circumstances
may arise under which, for the public safety,
flagrant injustice towards an individual may be
and ought to be committed. That is undoubtedly
the feeling at the bottom of Mr. Froude’s argument.
Possibly also it was at the back of Father Taunton’s
mind; but he does not put it forward. If the
doctrine itself be admitted, a loyal son of the Roman
Church is perhaps entitled to hold that it was right
to sacrifice Katharine in order to avoid raising a
question extremely inconvenient to the Papacy.
Perhaps also that view is the excuse least derogatory
to Wolsey which can be offered. A review, however,
of the entire context of the documents which Father
Taunton cites in part points rather to the conclusion
that the Cardinal did mean to argue that&mdash;dispensation
or no dispensation&mdash;affinity was an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
bar; and intended to fall back on the quibble only
as a last desperate resort if the contraction of affinity
were disproved; that he at least wished to find the
moral ground for nullity maintained, but, if that
should prove impossible, was prepared to surrender
the extreme Papal claim.</p>

<p>The view of the whole business resulting from a
consideration of all the facts so far as they can be
certainly ascertained is entirely consistent with the
rest of the Cardinal’s career. Ambition made him
desire power; like other men of great intellect and
strong will, he knew himself fitted to hold it; like
many other statesmen, and with a good deal more
reason than some, he imagined himself the only safe
guide for the State; and he knew that if he once
fell there would be for him no recovery. About
1526, when for a dozen years he had been the greatest
figure in the eyes of the Western world, he found
himself presented with a dilemma. He must execute
the king’s will in a particular matter&mdash;or fall.</p>

<p>The king’s will would at least serve the State well
in one respect if it issued in providing a male heir
to the throne. Also, if the marriage were really
contrary to the moral law and outside the dispensing
power, it would be in the interest of public morals
that the fact should be declared. So far, no one
could possibly be blamed for maintaining the king’s
case. That was the line subsequently taken by
Cranmer. But for Wolsey the situation was much
more difficult than for Cranmer, because for Wolsey
it was a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua non</i> that the Pope’s official authority
should be maintained. He could not, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
adopt any course which ignored that authority even
so far as by not requiring its open sanction: much
less could he, like Cranmer, defy it. Whether, for
the sake of preserving that authority the more
rigidly, he intended to ignore the one moral defence
for the desired measure and content himself with
pleading a legal quibble, is a question that can be
argued; but it is quite clear that he was prepared
to do so in the last resort. In short, if the only way
to avoid his own downfall was by sacrificing an innocent
victim, the innocence of the victim should not
save her. He would have preferred, no doubt, that
the sacrifice should not be made, but, under the
circumstances, he did not hesitate. His moral plane
was too conventionally low for the alternative
course. More or Fisher would have acted otherwise.
But the successful statesman who is ready to commit
political suicide rather than actively participate
in an unrighteous deed which he cannot prevent, is
not often to be met with. And Wolsey had the
further excuse that he hoped to save the Church,
as he conceived it, from the disastrous results which
he foresaw if the matter fell into other hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">WOLSEY AND THE REFORMATION</span></h3>

<p>From the attitude of Wolsey to the Papacy in the
matter of the divorce, we are naturally led to a
consideration of his whole position in matters ecclesiastical
and religious.</p>

<p>The great revolution which we call the Reformation
had two main aspects. Employing the term
“the Church” as representing not the whole body
of professing Christians but the clerical organisation:
the Reformation in the first place changed everywhere,
though in varying degrees, the relation of the
secular governments to the Church within their
borders; in the second place it changed the relations
of the various geographical sections of the Church
to the whole Catholic body of which they were
members. Thus the State in England assumed a
new attitude to the Church in England, and the
Church in England as well as the State was placed
in a new relation to the Roman pontificate. These
changes were essentially political.</p>

<p>In its second aspect, the Reformation was a
religious revolution; a revision of ethical standards;
a revival of that ardour of sentiment and of conviction
whereof martyrs are born; a spiritual movement,
accompanied by a doctrinal upheaval. That portion
of Christendom which adhered to the Roman pontificate,
confining its doctrinal modifications within
the limits set by the Council of Trent, arrogated to
itself the title of Catholic. The rest arrogated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
themselves the title of the Reformed Churches,
accepting the general label of Protestants originally
appropriate only to the Lutheran section. Like all
political labels, all three of these terms were incorrect,
“Protestant” being improperly extended, while
the “Reformed” Churches might be Catholic, and
the “Catholic” Church was itself reformed. Perhaps
it would be of advantage rather to treat the doctrinal
Reformation as a third aspect, and to distinguish
the great actors by the parts they played in the
political, the religious, and the doctrinal Reformations
respectively, whether in restraining or in promoting
change. Thus, religion did not enter into the programme
of Henry VIII.; as to doctrine he certainly
was not a reformer; politically, he emerged as a
revolutionary. Men like More and Colet were ardent
reformers of religion; in theology and on the political
side, they were conservative. Luther, Calvin and
Knox were of the advanced party in each case. But
it must be definitely laid down that of the three
aspects of the Reformation the most vital was the
religious, not the political or the theological; and
the men who, whether Catholic or Protestant, were
the religious leaders, are on a higher plane of greatness
than the rest; it is amongst them that we must
look for the “master-minds” of the age.</p>

<p>Now it does not appear that in any single one of
these three aspects Wolsey as a matter of fact influenced
the great movement, already fairly under
weigh, in any appreciable degree. Had he, instead
of Clement, occupied the Papal throne, the political
power of the Papacy would indubitably have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for the time greatly advanced. Had his own power
in England survived the divorce business, the secular
onslaught on the ecclesiastical body conducted by
Cromwell would not have taken place. It is conceivable
that under modified circumstances he might
have evolved a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus vivendi</i> for Church and State
more favourable to the Church than that which
emerged from the thirty tempestuous years which
followed his death. But in fact the whole manner of
the Cardinal’s life, his immersion in secular politics,
the magnificence of his household, his many benefices,
his vast accumulation of wealth, the arrogance of
his demeanour, typified and flaunted before the public
eye precisely those shortcomings of the clergy at
large on which the anti-clerical spirit of the laity was
battening. The Cardinal might have strengthened
the Church’s power of resistance; he certainly was
in no small degree the cause of the animosity of her
assailants. In the eyes of the whole world, he was
essentially a man of the world, worldly; and in
worldliness, far more than in the temptations of
the Flesh or the Devil, the best of the reformers
found the Church’s besetting sin.</p>

<p>No political skill, no state-craft, no loyalty to
his order, could have gone to the root of the matter
by removing the moral grounds of hostility to the
ecclesiastical organisation. A moral enthusiasm of
which&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;no hint whatever is to
be found in the great minister, was absolutely
essential for any man who was either to renovate
the prestige of the clergy so that the people should
follow them or so to inspire the people that the clergy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
should follow the popular movement. In England
there arose no prophet, but for that much-needed
<i>rôle</i> Wolsey was about as little fitted as any imaginable
leader.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, something he did and more he was
willing to do. There were specific grievances which
up to a certain point he sought to remedy. Without
surrendering any of the privileges of his order, he
made in his own Legatine Courts a vast improvement
on the practice of the ordinary Ecclesiastical Courts.
He did away with a considerable number of small
religious Houses whose condition was more or less
of a scandal. His visitations brought about improved
discipline in many of the larger Houses;
some of his appointments, as to the Abbey at Glastonbury,
were notably admirable; in rejecting an
unworthy abbess for Wilton he braved the anger
of the king at a time when he ran an exceptionally
heavy risk in doing so. Above all, he was fully alive
to the necessity of educating a new generation of
clergy up to a high standard; and to that end he
created his great foundations of Ipswich and Cardinal
College (Christ Church), Oxford, carrying out on
a much more extensive scale what Dean Colet and
Bishop Fox had set themselves to do before him.
His college was crippled and his school was wrecked
when he fell; but in this at least he deserves to be
honoured by the side of William of Wickham. Yet
the name of William is hardly to be coupled with
those of Luther or Loyola. Wolsey was a real and
sincere patron of education; he had a sufficiently
keen sense of order and public decency to be a just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
judge and something of a disciplinarian; but much
more than this would have been required to make
him a potent moral force; and without being that
he could not, even had he become Pope, have
affected the Reformation in a permanent manner,
though he might have modified its political course.
He was the consummation of the old school of political
ecclesiastics. Probably he was never so much as
conscious that a moral revolution was in progress.
What he did know was that the political position of
the Holy See, and of the whole ecclesiastical system,
was threatened, and his legatine and Papal ambitions
may fairly be attributed as much to a belief in his
own fitness to pilot the ship as to selfishly personal
motives. But the mere fact that, with the powers
he did acquire and the vast abilities he possessed,
he yet accomplished practically nothing either as a
reformer or as a bulwark of the old order, is fairly
conclusive proof that he was neither the “greatest
of English statesmen” nor “the master-mind of his
age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">WOLSEY’S FALL AND CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p>The Legatine Court was suspended, and the question
of the divorce advoked to Rome, in July 1529. The
signs of Wolsey’s doom were quick to gather. His
master practically ceased to hold personal communication
with him. It was evident, when writs for a
Parliament were issued in September, that the
Cardinal was no longer directing the king: for he
had consistently aimed so far as possible at the suppression
of the functions of Parliament. Campeggio
was hardly out of the country when his colleague
was indicted under the Statute of Præmunire for
having exercised the legatine office contrary to the
law. The Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk deprived
him of the Great Seal which he held as Chancellor.
Ill and despairing, he retired to his house at Esher,
shorn of all his offices. He was attainted in the
House of Peers, and the Bill was passed. In the
Commons, however, the vigorous opposition to it
made by Cromwell, and a feeling that the king was
not unfavourable to its rejection, resulted in its being
thrown out.</p>

<p>Probably Henry had not yet thoroughly made
up his mind as to his course of action, and wished to
preserve a possibility of recalling his minister to his
counsels. He was told that he might be permitted
to discharge some of his pastoral functions, and was
allowed to retire in the spring to York, to take up
the duties of the Archbishopric; and in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
immense fines imposed on him, he was by no means
stripped bare of this world’s goods. York was fixed
on as being more remote from the neighbourhood
both of Henry and of the Continent than Winchester.
He threw himself into the unaccustomed
<i>rôle</i> with apparent zest, and seemed on the verge of
achieving an unexpected reputation for pastoral
piety and devotion, when a fresh blow fell. He was
summoned to London on a charge of treason. He
had been unwise enough to write to Francis I and
pray for his intercession with Henry; he was also
accused, though groundlessly, of having made really
treasonous proposals to the Pope. Already ill when
he started, he became rapidly worse on his journey
south, and having reached the Abbey of Leicester,
was unable again to rise from his bed. There he
passed away, pathetically forlorn; but at least
spared the last undeserved ignominy of a traitor’s
doom.</p>

<p>On the high road to success and in the height of
his power, Wolsey extorts an admiration which is
still somewhat reluctant. His figure cannot be called
attractive. Over the business of the divorce it is
difficult not to feel him positively repellent. But
in his fall he rose to moral heights of which his
previous career gives no warning. What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul? Here, it would seem, was one who&mdash;not
voluntarily surrendering but forcibly bereft of the
world, when he had gained it&mdash;found thereby his
soul’s salvation. Through tears and tribulation, pain
of the worn-out body, anguish of the spirit, he won it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
In the day of his triumph, his countrymen hated him
while they could not but admire; hated him with
a rare bitterness which made even Thomas More
ungenerous; save some few of his own household,
none felt a touch of sympathy, unless perhaps the
king, who condescended to send him one or two kindly
messages to salve his own royal conscience while he
was stripping his most loyal servant of everything
he possessed. Yet in the months of his retirement,
while, in his diocese of York, he devoted himself
to the care of his spiritual flock, the fallen Cardinal
won on all hands a passionate affection bestowed
only upon men and women who can forget themselves
in their thought for others. At bottom there must
have been in the man an essential sweetness and
loveableness repressed&mdash;dried up in the fires of
ambition, parched in the sunshine of prosperity,
welling forth in the shadow of adversity. Gone was
the power that swayed the politics of a continent;
gone the gorgeous pomp, the insolent state, that
stirred the impotent malice of the lesser men
he had overshadowed. But with their loss, the
hidden best that was in the fallen minister found free
play.</p>

<p>Wolsey’s chroniclers have been against him.
Those who wished to magnify the king pointed to
the Cardinal as the evil genius who had prompted
every ill-judged deed. The nobility hated him as
an insolent and upstart foe to their order. Katharine’s
party hated him, because he was credited not only
with anti-Spanish policy but with being the prime
mover of the divorce. The Boleyn party hated him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
because they knew that he loathed the Boleyn
marriage. He had no sympathy from the Protestants,
since he stood for the old ecclesiastical order;
none from the later Catholics, since his attitude to
the Papacy was misunderstood; none from the
populace, because he embodied the most unpopular
characteristics of ecclesiasticism. Even Cavendish,
who admired him, is careful in his record to point
the moral that pride goeth before a fall, lest his
praise of the Cardinal’s demeanour in his last year
of life should be regarded as unduly laudatory.
From Skelton to Fox the martyrologist, every man
had some motive for throwing a stone at him.</p>

<p>But if Shakespeare&mdash;or another&mdash;has summed
up for us the libels of his enemies, the same hand
has shaped the far truer eulogium pronounced
by the “honest chronicler” Griffith in the same
play. By his own talents he had made himself
great: in his high station, if in some respects he
abused his power, yet in the main he worked for the
glory of England. It is inconceivable that when
he fell, when the world slipped from the grasp of
one who had been the very type of worldliness, he
should have kissed the rod with perfect resignation,
and found no taste of bitterness in the cup allotted
to him. Yet there was at least a solid proportion of
truth in the pious words of Griffith:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His overthrow heaped happiness upon him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then, and not till then, he felt himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found the blessedness of being little;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to add greater honours to his age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than man could give him, he died fearing God.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>
<p>No amount of historical inquiry will ever suffice
to displace in the public mind a portrait bearing
Shakespeare’s signature. The Wolsey of the play
is not easy to reconcile with the Wolsey Griffith
described after his disappearance from the stage:
but these words are still a part of the Shakespearean
portrait.</p>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>

<p>Reverence for tradition is not inconsistent with a
belief in progress. History yields us abundant
instances of great minds which have combined a
keen appreciation of the ideas of liberty and equality
with a strong predilection in favour of time-honoured
institutions. Sometimes, but rarely, the conservative
instinct predominates in youth, and gives way
to the liberal instinct as time goes on. Sometimes,
not rarely, the liberalism of youth yields to the
conservatism of later life. In either case, we are
presented with the apparent paradox of the man
who, maintaining the complete consistency of his
own career, is found to be at one period of his life on
the side of the reformers, and at another period on
the side of the reactionaries. When political movements
are comparatively slow, these paradoxes do
not obtrude themselves: but when revolutions are
in the air, they become conspicuous. There are
two eras which are particularly fruitful in such
phenomena; those, namely, of the Reformation
and of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Each of those periods presents us in England with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
one political thinker of the highest rank whose
utterances before the great change are cited in
authority by progressives, while their later pronouncements
or actions are cited with approbation
by the opposing forces. There is nothing surprising
about the change in political attitude which unexpected
events produce in a Stephen Gardiner
or a William Pitt; it is merely a divergence from
the earlier course. But Burke and More give a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima facie</i> impression of a complete reversal of
principle. “Miscalculation and inconsistency were
the moving causes of the vicissitudes of Thomas
More’s career”; so Mr. Sidney Lee has very recently
written of him; as other critics have fallen back
on the theory that Burke’s intellect went to pieces.
Both these great men did, in fact, misinterpret the
very startling events of which they were witness,
partly because actual facts was misrepresented to
them. Neither believed that a work-a-day world
with established institutions could be accommodated
to ideal polities where those institutions had never
grown up. They had in practice to adapt their
ideals to what they saw as hard facts. Hence they
condemned in the concrete what they would have
approved in the abstract. Yet both were close
and acute reasoners, and probably neither would
have admitted for a moment that he had deserted
in later life a single principle which he had maintained
at an earlier stage.</p>

<p>But whether critics differ in their attempts to
reconcile the More who wrote the “Utopia” with the
Lord Chancellor More, or give up the attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>explain the paradox as hopeless, the attractiveness
and nobility of the man stand unchallenged, as his
intellectual eminence is indisputable. It is impossible
not to love and admire him. Of the other nine men
treated in this volume, all have apologists more or
less enthusiastic, but all have bitterly or contemptuously
hostile critics. More is one of the few men
that have left their mark on our history, who has
won the tribute of universal affection and esteem.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">UNDER HENRY VII</span></h3>

<p>Thomas More was born in London in 1478, seven
years after Thomas Wolsey, and about the same
length of time before Thomas Cromwell. There is
a rather curious prevalence of the name Thomas
among prominent men at this time, Cranmer being
a fourth, and the youngest of the quartet. More’s
father was a barrister, who later became a judge;
a gentleman with a pleasant humour, a turn for
economy, and conservative views. John More was
married thrice, and seems to have been comfortably
wived, being responsible for a witticism on the subject
of matrimony such as usually emanates from men
whose personal experience contradicts it. “Taking
a wife,” said he, “is like putting your hand into a
bag containing a number of snakes and one eel. You
<i>may</i> lay hold of the eel.” His son was not warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
off the experiment, either by the jest or by his experience
of step-mothers.</p>

<p>Young Thomas was a lad of parts; his father was
a person of distinction in the great city. Morton,
Archbishop and Lord Chancellor, and subsequently
a Cardinal, the wise counsellor of Henry VII. throughout
the first half of his reign, took the boy into his
service, and evidently found much satisfaction in
cultivating and encouraging his remarkable intelligence
and wit; prophesying “marvellous things”
of him. The great man’s kindness was repaid by
the very attractive portrait which his <i>protégé</i> has
given us in the first book of the “Utopia.” By
Morton’s influence, Thomas, at fourteen, was sent to
Oxford&mdash;not an unusual age. Cranmer too was
sent to Cambridge at fourteen: while Wolsey’s
youth was exceptional, for he took his degree at the
same age. More’s undergraduate career, however,
was brief. He was intended by his father to follow
the profession of the law, and John More took
alarm when he found that his son was being beguiled
into an enthusiasm for the recently introduced study
of Greek. There was no connexion between law and
Greek; besides, Greek was unsettling: it seemed to
put new-fangled and heterodox ideas into folk’s
heads. So after two years, More was withdrawn
from Oxford, entered at New Inn to study the law,
and in February, 1496, was admitted a student at
Lincoln’s Inn: just about the time when John Colet
was returning from Italy.</p>

<p>There is every probability that Colet and his
younger contemporary had already foregathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
at Oxford, in listening to the teaching of Grocyn:
otherwise it is not very easy to account for the
warm intimacy which arose between the Oxford
Divinity Lecturer and the young student of Lincoln’s
Inn: though the fact that both their fathers were
men of such eminence in London, that the families
may easily have been brought into contact, must
not be forgotten. In any case, the names of Colet,
Erasmus and More became closely associated
between 1496 and 1500. Erasmus paid a flying
visit to England in 1498. Colet’s discourses were
already famous, and the Dutchman and the Englishman
were introduced to each other by Prior Charnock
of the College of St. Mary the Virgin: to their great
mutual satisfaction. As the story runs, Colet told
Erasmus of the surprising genius of his young friend
Thomas More, and told More of the amazing endowments
of his new acquaintance. The two, unknown
to each other, met at the same table, and fell into a
dialectical discussion which neither could resist;
till at last the elder, putting two and two together,
exclaimed “Aut tu es Morus, aut nullus,” the
younger promptly responding “Aut tu es Erasmus,
aut Diabolus.” Whether the tale be true or not,
the acquaintance was made, and ripened rapidly
into the warmest of friendships. In those days,
complimentary epithets between scholars were nearly
as cheap and meant nearly as little, as vituperative
ones; but there is no mistake about the genuine
and spontaneous character of the terms in which
Erasmus wrote to and of Thomas More. He is
always <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dulcissimus</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">iucundissimus</i>, or something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
equally endearing. Erasmus had superlatives for
other people too, but there is no one else on whom
he lavishes the same wealth of playful affection. It
was to Robert Fisher that the scholar about this
time wrote his classic appreciation of his young friend&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Thomae
Mori ingenio quid unquam finxit natura
vel mollius, vel dulcius, vel felicius?</i> “What hath
nature ever fashioned more tender, more charming,
more happy, than the character of Thomas More?”</p>

<p>It was during this visit that More played a characteristic
trick on Erasmus, one which shows how
well the quondam page of Cardinal Morton (who
had just entered on the last year of his life) stood in
distinguished quarters. Erasmus was staying at
Greenwich with his patron Lord Mountjoy. Thither
came More, with a friend, to see him and carry him
off for a walk, in the course of which they came to
a handsome building, where More said he wished
to pay his respects. Somewhat to his dismay,
Erasmus found on entering that they were invading
a royal domain, and that their visit was to Prince
Henry and his brother and sisters who wanted
him there and then to produce them a poem. He
demurred, but was let off on condition of his
promising to send them one&mdash;a promise faithfully
carried out.</p>

<p>More shared with his older friend a capacity for
perceiving the humorous side of things which stood
him in good stead all his life. But he had a deeper
vein of seriousness, and to him&mdash;as to Colet&mdash;religion
meant a great deal more than it did to the cosmopolitan
scholar. The profession for which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
still training&mdash;he was not yet called to the Bar&mdash;was
one to which his abilities were eminently adapted,
and his intimacy with Colet did not prevent him
from loyally devoting his time and his studies to that
training, as his father desired. But as soon as he
was duly called, he began to give his natural predilections
freer play, and we find him delivering in the
City a course of lectures on Augustine’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Civitate
Dei</i>: to the admiration of his old master Grocyn
and others. Not, however, to the neglect of his
legal pursuits, for he was appointed Reader at
Furnivall’s Inn; or of larger ambitions, for, young
as he was, he appeared as a member of Henry VII.’s
Parliament of 1504. The story of the “beardless
boy” persuading that assembly to reject a royal
demand for cash, as told by his son-in-law William
Roper, is familiar; and even if not altogether
accurately reported, leaves no doubt that he did so
offend Henry that he felt it advisable to retire into
political obscurity&mdash;the king characteristically taking
his revenge by extracting a fine from his father.</p>

<p>It may have been this episode which gave him a
temporary inclination to betake himself to a monastic
life: but this did not last. Investigation did not
lead to the conclusion that life in a monastery was
quite the same in practice as in theory, and a <i>penchant</i>
for asceticism could be indulged without
entering the cloister. Moreover, this summer Colet
was in London, probably to commence work at St.
Paul’s, where he had just been nominated to the
Deanery; and Colet was not the man to counsel
such a step. On the contrary, he advised his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
to marry, and the advice was taken next <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span>
The story is quaintly characteristic. Visiting “one
Mr. Colte a gentleman of Essex,” he was attracted
by the three daughters of the house. The second
being the prettiest, took his fancy, but he thought
it would be hard on the elder sister if the younger
got a husband first, so he “of a certayne pittie
framed his fancie towardes her” instead&mdash;with
excellent results.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Roper’s chronology is not very intelligible. He says that&mdash;after
being called to the Bar&mdash;More was three years a Reader at
Furnivall’s Inn, and then passed four years in the Charterhouse
without taking the vows. The other evidence, however, points
pretty conclusively to 1505 as the date of his marriage.</p></div>

<p>On the whole it does not look as if More went in
any very great fear of the old king’s wrath. Mr.
Colte would not have been in a hurry to bestow
his daughter in marriage on a young man whom Henry
was seeking occasion to slay: and probably More
himself would have hesitated to give hostages to
fortune under those conditions.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EARLY YEARS OF HENRY VIII</span></h3>

<p>Whatever reason he may have had to fear ill-will
from Henry VII.&mdash;who seldom wasted vindictive
sentiments on people whose punishment could not
be substantially expressed in terms of hard cash&mdash;More
could count on the goodwill of his young
successor. More than one of the princes of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
days ranked among the most accomplished men of
their times; and like his brother-in-law of Scotland,
Henry would have more than held his own in any
company, intellectual or athletic. As yet, the world
did not know that his abilities were matched by a
ruthless selfishness. He seemed a brilliant and
charming boy, frank-hearted and open-handed, with
just the carelessness becoming to his age: the very
reverse of the old king as men thought of him in his
later years, sordid, crafty, griping. The reign of
Empsons and Dudleys was at an end; the approach
to the new king’s favour was to be through very
different avenues. To have been in the black books
of Henry VII. was no reason for fearing Henry VIII.</p>

<p>More prospered rapidly in his profession, and had
no desire to be drawn to Court or into the whirl of
politics. He was very soon appointed to the important
office of Under-Sheriff in the City, and his
private practice was ere long bringing him a very
substantial income. Also, to his great satisfaction,
the expectation of a more cheerful <i>régime</i> in England
was bringing Erasmus back again&mdash;there had been
one flying visit in the interval&mdash;to write the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Encomium
Moriae</i> under More’s own roof, and still further
to enrich and stimulate that congenial intellectual
society in which More himself had been living ever
since Colet had taken up his duties as Dean of St.
Paul’s.</p>

<p>But however little ambitious More might be, his
talents were too conspicuous to permit of his being
left alone. In 1515, the commercial war with Flanders&mdash;an
outcome of the foreign complications in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
which Henry VIII. had become involved&mdash;was
embarrassing both countries so much that there was
a strong desire for adjustment. An embassy was
to be sent, with Cuthbert Tunstall at its head. The
merchants of London desired to be represented;
they wanted More to represent them; Wolsey, now
supreme, acceded; More was attached to the embassy,
and the abilities he displayed marked him out as
a man fitted for the king’s service. For a time More
resisted; but his masterly conduct of a case in which
he was appointed as counsel for the Pope (in respect
of a ship which the Crown claimed as forfeit) caused
Henry to put renewed pressure on him. In 1518,
he had become a courtier in his own despite. This,
by the way, may have some bearing on the fact
that in that year his father was elevated to the
judicial Bench.</p>

<p>Some years earlier, More’s domestic life had
suffered: his first wife dying in 1512 and leaving
him with four little children on his hands. To
provide the orphans with a mother, he took to himself
a second wife, some years older than himself;
a kindly conventional soul, as it would seem, who
quite understood that her husband was a very clever
man, but was eternally puzzled by his disregard of
worldly considerations, and hopelessly confused
by the whimsical irony with which he loved to meet
her “Tilly vally, Sir Thomas,” when he had been
doing something peculiarly exasperating from her
point of view. She mothered his children, and himself
as much as he would let her; and never succeeded
in disturbing his humorous equanimity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
though her own must have been everlastingly
ruffled.</p>

<p>The embassy to the Netherlands sealed More’s
fate, by forcing him into political life. It is also
intimately associated with the one great original
literary work produced in England in the first half
of the sixteenth century: a work which established
the fame of its author as a political thinker of the
highest rank, in spite of the intentionally fantastic
form in which it was cast.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE UTOPIA</span></h3>

<p>Throughout More’s life, revolutionary forces had
been at work in the political, the intellectual, and
the religious world; but as yet they had not concentrated
in any volcanic explosion. At present,
More’s most intimate associates stood in the very
forefront of the most advanced school, and his
“Utopia” was to make his position beside them as
conspicuous to the world as it was assured in fact.
He had taken to Greek, in spite of his anxious
parent, like a duck to water: his affinity to the
Platonic Socrates is obvious. John Colet was his
guide, philosopher and friend; and the downright
reactionaries, like the Bishop of London, had vain
hankerings to suppress Colet as a dangerous heretic.
He was the chosen intellectual mate of Erasmus,
who had done or was doing more than any man living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
to rid men’s minds of the shackles of the old scholastic
formalism. The grosser popular superstitions, the
worship of the letter and neglect of the spirit, the
pursuit of worldly advancement by the successors
of the apostles, were constant subjects for pulpit
castigations by the one friend, and the lively and
scathing mockery of the other. The mediæval
theory that war is a pastime for the ambitions of
princes was vigorously denounced by both. In all
these things More was with them heart and soul;
and he had already given audacious indication of
his belief that the function of government is to seek
the good not of the governors but of the governed,
when he incurred the displeasure of Henry VII. in
1504. This progressive attitude of mind found its
complete expression in the fantasy of Utopia.</p>

<p>The notion of constructing an imaginary Commonwealth
under ideal conditions on ideal lines was
of course derived straight from Plato’s Republic.
That any existing State could be reformed into the
semblance of such a Commonwealth by the fiat of
legislators, neither Plato nor More ever dreamed.
Neither the Republic nor the Utopia is in the nature
of one of those paper Constitutions whose devisers
would fain impose them in all their logical perfection
upon recalcitrant nations. They aim at setting
forth those fundamental principles which must
indeed lie at the root of all healthy forms of government,
but must also inevitably materialise into
different shapes under differing conditions. The
reproach that such schemes are not practical, which
is damning to a paper Constitution, is here wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
irrelevant. They were never meant to be practical.
Sir Galahad is not a practical model for the British
citizen, who would take warning from the career
of the Knight of La Mancha. Yet the conception of
Sir Galahad is worthy of serious contemplation by
the British citizen, who may therefrom derive not a
little practical direction in the conduct of his life.
To condemn the presentation of avowed ideals as
unpractical, is merely to display a complete misapprehension
of the meaning and use of ideals.</p>

<p>More, however, did not derive his method from
Plato. The Athenian started by looking for the
logical principles on which a State should be constructed,
and built it, storey by storey. The
Englishman imagined his State already complete
and expounded the finished structure; taking
example by other myths than the Republic. With
happy ingenuity, he made use of a suggestion from
the records of the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci
to locate his dream-city in realms which some of that
eminent traveller’s company might have visited,
alone of Europeans. In similarly happy vein, he
utilised his embassy to the Netherlands to provide
an introduction, the form of which was doubtless
suggested by Platonic precedent, though it is in
no sense an imitation. The characterisation of the
persons whose conversation is reported is not unworthy
of the master.</p>

<p>The work is in two parts: the account of Utopia
itself, and this preliminary book, which introduces
the traveller Hythloday, with his criticisms on
European politics in general, and the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
England in particular. This, More would have
us believe, is the way in which a foreign Odysseus
having “viewed the cities and marked the ways of
many a People” would judge the institutions on
which the Englishman prided himself. The suggestion
that he wished to make himself safe by
attributing those criticisms to some one else is hardly
tenable. It does not appear that any one ever
suspected Hythloday of having had a more material
existence than Lemuel Gulliver after him. The
intention is simply to dispose the reader’s mind
so as to accept the verisimilitude of what he knows
to be a fiction; the intention of every dramatic
artist. Reason tells you that you are sitting in a
theatre and watching actors behind the footlights.
Imagination tells you that real events are going on
before your eyes. If imagination fails, tragedy
becomes burlesque, and comedy silliness. The description
of Utopia appeals with tenfold force when
your imagination accepts it as a place which a real
human traveller has seen; and the illusion is only
possible when the real human traveller has been
convincingly presented. Raphael Hythloday is as
real as Robinson Crusoe. But there is no reason
to suppose that More wanted any one to think that
Hythloday had an address in Antwerp&mdash;as Peter
Giles says, “Some ... for that his minde and
affection was altogether set and fixed upon Utopia,
say that he hathe taken his voyage thetherwards
agayne.” “No-where land” is the unsubstantial
resting-place of the non-material but convincing
traveller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Similarly, by putting his criticisms on English
affairs into the mouth of a foreign observer, from
whose lips they come with a perfect fitness, the
artist procures for them an attention and consideration
which would be refused if they were being
thought of as the criticisms of an Englishman
vilifying his own country. Again, the illusion is
needed only till the required effect is produced,
namely, recognition of the validity of the criticism.</p>

<p>The illusion is created with subtle skill. More
relates how he was sent on the Netherlands embassy,
with various references to his associates, and the
actual facts of that episode in his career, and tells
how his (real) friend, Peter Giles of Antwerp, introduced
the traveller Hythloday&mdash;an interesting person
who had voyaged to those lands of which Europeans
as yet knew exceedingly little and imagined an
infinite deal. More draws him out, and extracts
from him his impression of England, where he had
visited Cardinal Morton, of the state of Europe in
general, and finally, by way of contrast, of that
remote and unknown State of Utopia, which has
opened his eyes to what lies at the root of so much
that is unsatisfactory in the realms of Christendom.
Thus More is enabled to win interested attention to
his own criticism of the social and political conditions
prevalent, and his own political philosophy.
Whatever the latter may be, the former is as practical
as possible.</p>

<p>The picture given of the world in which men were
actually living and moving, and pursuing their
business or their pleasure, is vivid and impressive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Moreover, its truth is borne out by all other evidence.
It is the work of a keen and humorous observer;
and the analysis of the causes of the pervading evils
is unerring. It was no doubt wise of More to antedate
the description by a score or so of years, referring it
to Cardinal Morton’s days; but in 1515, every evil
depicted had become even more marked&mdash;and, it
may be said, continued to increase progressively
until the reign of Elizabeth, the same causes continuing
to operate, with the addition of others which
intensified the effects. Every rising in the reigns
of Henry VIII., of Edward VI., and of Mary, whatever
its ostensible ground, bears unmistakeable
signs that the agricultural depression with its
attendant evils was a secondary, if not the primary
cause.</p>

<p>It would be too much to expect that the remedies
More recommended should have been equally above
criticism. Economic science was in its earliest
infancy; in spite of experience, no one had begun
to suspect the inefficacy of legislation in certain
directions, and there are plenty of people who still
believe that natural forces can be regulated by
statute. In no single respect was any thinker of
his times in advance of Sir Thomas More in these
matters. But in many respects he was in advance
not only of the foremost of his contemporaries,
but even of current opinion and practice three
hundred years later.</p>

<p>Thus, after describing the prevalence of thieving
and robbery, he points to idleness as its cause, but
dwells emphatically on the distinction between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
idleness which is of choice and that which is enforced
by lack of employment. Half the thieves would
be honest labourers if they had the chance. The
maintenance or development of industries which
provide employment would be an effective cure;
but instead of seeking a cure, the authorities fall
back on punishment. But the severity of the law,
instead of checking the minor misdemeanours,
converts the pickpocket into a dangerous robber
who&mdash;having no worse penalty to fear for the graver
offence&mdash;resorts to violence without hesitation: so
that the system regularly manufactures the worst
ruffianism.</p>

<p>The instability and disorganisation of industry
produced by what we now call “corners,” has its
prototype in the “engrossing” and “forestalling,”
by which wealthy men make themselves monopolists.
The inevitable tendency of capital to flow
in dividend-producing, not philanthropic, channels,
is foreshadowed by the steady conversion by wealth-seeking
landlords of arable land into sheep-runs;
a process which left much of the rural population
without work, wages, food, or home. Incidentally
it may be noted that, while modern historians are
disposed rather to dwell on the substitution of
greedy laymen for the monasteries as landlords
as one of the later causes of this particular trouble,
More expressly includes “certeyn abbottes, holy
men no doubt,” in his denunciation thereof. He
may, however, mean no more than that even the
Church was not exempt from this reproach. In
dealing with this economic tendency for capital to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
seek the most lucrative channel, More made the
universal mistake of his day in believing that it
could be effectively restrained by Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>In a vein no less practical, and no less opposed
to the conventional ideas of the time, and with a still
more playful seriousness, the traveller discourses
of high politics and finance as they were debated
in the Cabinets of Europe, with the aggrandisement
and enrichment of monarchs as the one end in view.
“‘This myne advyce, maister More,’ says he, ‘how
think you it would be harde and taken?’ ‘So
God helpe me, not very thankefully’ quod I.’”</p>

<p>By this discussion, the way is prepared for Hythloday
to favour his company with an account of the
remarkable polity which he found in Utopia (a
State as to the whereabouts of which More subsequently
writes in anxious inquiry to Peter Giles,
who answers in the like vein of pretended regret at
being unable to answer the question). This account
occupies the second book, forming about two-thirds
of the whole work.</p>

<p>In this fantasy, practicality vanishes at the outset.
Such are the defences, natural or artificial, of this
most favoured island, that any would-be invader
is doomed to certain destruction, while the country
produces everything that man requires for comfort.
It needs no army and no navy, self-defence and self-assertion
being equally superfluous: its relations
with foreign States are purely complimentary. The
Utopians make no foreign leagues. Where the bonds
of goodwill are not sufficient to maintain friendly relations,
nations enter upon leagues, but only to desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
them at the first call of interest. Such is the strange
conviction of the Utopians, though they had not
themselves experienced the kaleidoscopic permutations
and combinations of Ferdinand the Catholic,
Maximilian, Louis XII., Henry VII., Julius II.,
and the Venetians. If by any chance they find it
necessary to go to war, there is a convenient breed
of fighting men in a country not too far away, who
can always be hired for the purpose.</p>

<p>Being thus preserved from the creation of a military
caste, while universal education has prevented
knowledge from being concentrated in a priestly
caste, it has been easy to prevent the development
of any sort of privileged class through the accumulation
of private property, which is prohibited. Hence,
in Utopia, communism is practicable, and the whole
system is as a matter of course communistic, though
the principle is not extended to the relations between
the sexes. Having arrived at their religion not
through the Christian Revelation, but by Reason,
any religious views are tolerated which are not
manifestly anti-social. It is a corollary of these
conditions that government is in the hands of
elected magistrates, who have neither class interests
nor personal interests to deflect them from their
proper function of ruling with a single eye to the
interests of the whole people. The possibility that
sectarian interests might have developed as a disturbing
factor does not seem to have presented itself;
perhaps, where no religious views might be aggressively
expressed or repressed, no strife of sects was
to be feared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
In every direction, of course, the manners and
customs of the Utopians suggest that the manners
and customs of the English are susceptible of improvement.
They take a philosophic view of the
pleasures of life, reckoning the gratification of
animal appetites exceedingly low in practice as
well as in theory. They have no lust of gold and
jewels. They have no craving for display, for
gambling, for the baser forms of sport. On the other
hand, they appreciate the value of sanitation. There
is no idleness, since every one is required to do his
share of work, but there is ample leisure for all;
instead of one half of the population having too
much, and the other half too little, to do. Thus
they can enjoy in abundance those rational pleasures
in which they take a true delight, abiding in health
and wealth.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">MORE IN PUBLIC LIFE</span></h3>

<p>It should be sufficiently clear that no one was more
thoroughly aware than Sir Thomas More himself
that the Utopian conditions could not be produced
in a European State, and that Utopian institutions
could only exist under Utopian conditions. Of
that fact he was destined to give practical demonstration
when called upon to discharge the functions of
a practical ruler.</p>

<p>In 1518 More became a Privy Councillor, and
probably his influence may be detected in the efforts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
renewed about this time, to check the conversion
of arable land into pasture, and the evil practice of
enclosures. But Martin Luther’s activity was just
beginning, and its results were to make the contrast
between Utopia and England even more marked than
previously. Before entering, however, on More’s attitude
to this new phase of the Reformation, we have
to note some other points in this stage of his career.</p>

<p>More stood in high favour. He had not climbed
to a great position by arduous effort; greatness,
worthy of it as he was, had been thrust upon him.
His advancement was promoted by Wolsey, who
was seldom vindictive except towards rivals whose
power might make them dangerous. In 1521 he
was knighted. When Parliament was summoned
in 1523 he was made Speaker, by no means at his
own desire, but chiefly at that of the King and the
Cardinal. The result was probably not quite what
Wolsey had anticipated. On his appointment, he
had implied very clearly, though in diplomatic
terms, that he meant to uphold freedom of speech
in the House. But the business on hand was the
voting of money, and Wolsey made the mistake
of attempting to overawe the Commons by coming
down to the House himself. The Members declined
to speak or vote in his presence; the Cardinal’s
demands were received with dead silence. Wolsey
turned on the Speaker. The Speaker made it perfectly
clear that the House could not give way on
the question of privilege. When Wolsey withdrew,
Parliament demonstrated its loyalty by making a
substantial grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
According to More’s son-in-law, this incident
brought More into the black books of the Cardinal,
who with ill intent tried to get him sent on an
embassy to Spain, under colour of complimenting
him. If Wolsey really meant evil by him, his designs
came to nothing, for there was no sign of any diminution
in the royal favour. Already, however, in 1525,
Wolsey’s position was becoming precarious, though
to all appearance he was as dominant as ever. More’s
next advancement was to the Chancellorship of the
Duchy of Lancaster in 1526; and from this time
Henry’s personal demands on his time and his society
became exceedingly pressing. A year later, the whole
of the king’s real interest was absorbed in the divorce
question, which was to seal Wolsey’s fate directly,
and More’s indirectly. Henry consulted him about it,
and More then as always told his master honest truth&mdash;he
did not see how the marriage with Katharine
could lawfully be voided. From that position he
never swerved. The king could respect conscientious
scruples on the part of a favourite, and did so
as long as More remained a favourite. More, however,
had no illusions about the king’s constancy.
“If my head,” he told Roper, “would win him a
castle in France, it should not fail to go.” But
when Henry decided that Wolsey could no longer
serve his turn, it was More whom he selected to fill
the office of Lord Chancellor, in spite of his views of
the divorce.</p>

<p>During these years, the uprising of Luther had
developed into a widespread religious revolt. Henry,
having no quarrel with Pope Leo, and proud of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
own attainments as a theologian, chose to enter the
lists for the demolition of Luther; producing an
apologia for the Papacy which earned him the title
of “Defender of the Faith.” Before publishing
this work he showed it to More, who warned him,
with shrewd foresight, that, if ever he did come to
have a quarrel with the Pope, he would find it very
difficult to get over his own argument, which proved
too much in support of Papal authority. Henry,
however, would not modify the view then expressed,
and succeeded in satisfying his counsellor that it
was sound. In due course the prophecy came true:
Henry repudiated the position he had formerly
defended. Unhappily for More, however, the king
had finally convinced him, and he declined to surrender
his conviction: with fatal consequences.</p>

<p>Viewed even exclusively as a religious movement,
Luther’s revolt would not have attracted More’s
sympathies. He had never doubted any of the
dogmas of the Church, though he had a plentiful
contempt for many prevailing corruptions which
were recognised as such by men to whom heresy was
never imputed by their bitterest enemy. He believed
with conviction a great deal that Erasmus accepted
merely <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro forma</i>. Luther not only propounded
views on specific dogmas which More regarded as
heretical, he challenged the whole authority of
Rome; and More believed in the authority of Rome.
But beyond all this the Lutheran revolt was very
soon followed by the German Peasant revolt, which
deluged half Europe with blood. The Peasants’
War was completely misapprehended in England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
where the agricultural troubles, bad as they were,
could bear no comparison with the oppression from
which the German peasants suffered; but its leadership
fell, naturally enough, into the hands of men
as fanatical in their zeal for religious as for social
reform. The overthrow of all authority and the
universal triumph of sheer anarchy appeared to be
their goal; and the world believed, or was taught
to believe, that it was Luther who had started the
conflagration. The heretical pamphlets which issued
from Germany and Switzerland&mdash;lumped together,
by those who did not know the facts, as Lutheran&mdash;gave
colour to this belief by the virulence of their
attacks on the Papacy and the clergy; and it is
small wonder that many of the most liberal-minded
men could anticipate nothing but stark ruin, the
coming of chaos, unless the torrent were stayed.
The threatening crash of all reverence, of all authority
save such as could be enforced by push of pike,
seemed to be brought measurably closer, when, in
1527, the Imperial armies sacked Rome in emulation
of Alaric, and the representative of St. Peter was
held a prisoner by the representative of Caesar
Augustus.</p>

<p>In the abstract, and under Utopian conditions,
More was singularly alive to the beauty of the principle
of practically universal toleration. But Europe
and England were presenting a problem which could
never have arisen in Utopia at all. Even in Utopia,
it was recognised that certain negations were directly
anti-social, and that the propagation of them must
be repressed. Here in Europe, it seemed as if every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
negation of a received dogma was to be turned into
an anti-social engine. Under the conditions, the
toleration of any heresy, certainly of all such as
palpably involved an attack on authority, tended to
anarchy. The conclusion that what was good
unreservedly in Utopia would not be good in England
is obvious. We can all see now, of course, that More
misinterpreted the facts. The anarchism was an
accident of the religious movement, which it shed of
itself, not an inherent part of it: the Church lost
as much ground by the action of her own zealots
as by the attacks of her most fanatical opponents.
But for a man who interpreted the facts as More
did, there was nothing inconsistent in declaring for
toleration in Utopia, but in England repression.</p>

<p>There is another point, too, which is generally
unnoticed. The Utopians arrived at their religion
by reason; they had no way of ascertaining truth
except through reason; hence, for one man to
condemn another for holding a different “doxy”
would be in itself irrational. Christendom, in More’s
view, was in a different position. It had received
Truth by direct Revelation, and an Exponent of
Truth by Divine appointment. What the Church
had definitely pronounced to be heterodox was to
be regarded finally and conclusively as false. To
permit the preaching of doctrine known to be false
was quite different from permitting the discussion
or inculcation of divergent opinions on which there
was no authority qualified to pronounce absolutely.
Even at the moment when More was describing the
religion of Utopia, before he had ever heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
name of Luther, he might with perfect consistency
have held that heresy ought to be repressed in
Christian countries. The argument, of course, has
nothing to do with the wisdom or unwisdom of a
repressive policy; it is concerned merely with the
“inconsistency” of More’s Utopian theory and his
Catholic practice. Those who found the Divine
Revelation not in the voice of the Church but in the
text of Scripture, were equally convinced that
deviation from indisputable Truth should be punished
by the strong hand.</p>

<p>Broadly, the suggestion here put forward is that the
Utopian religions are philosophies: that all philosophies
are matter of argument; that intolerance of
opinions which are matter of argument is irrational.
On the other hand (to More), Catholic Christianity
is not a philosophy, but is revealed truth; not therefore
matter of argument, except so far as details have
not been defined; that suppression of doctrines
subversive of Catholic truth is certainly legitimate,
and may be necessary.</p>

<p>However that may be, it is undeniable that More
appears in the least favourable light as a Catholic
controversialist; losing balance and tone, he writes
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">currente calamo</i>, without restraint, with lapse of
dignity, and with only an occasional redeeming turn
of humour. That is to say, he drops to the normal
level of contemporary controversialists on both
sides, instead of abiding in that serene atmosphere
which otherwise distinguishes him. The aggressive
bellicosity of princes grieved him, and the king’s
divorce business vexed him: but the spread of heresy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
was the one thing which upset his equanimity. “I
pray God,” said he to Roper, “that some of us, as
heigh as we seeme to sitt upon the mountaines,
treadinge heretickes under our feete like annts, live
not the day that we gladly would wish to be at leagge
and composition with them, to let them have their
Churches quietly to themselves; soe that they would
be content to lett us have ours quietly to our selves.”</p>

<p>Similarly, the one and only ground of reproach
against his conduct in any public matter is that as
Chancellor he may have sanctioned putting heretics
to the torture, and did during the last six months of
his office&mdash;not before&mdash;send certain heretics to the
stake. It is true that the only men in England, in
those days, who, having the opportunity, did not
send a single heretic to the fire, were the much-abused
Protector Somerset and the still more abused
Wolsey. But we would fain have had Thomas
More an exception. Still, it can at least be affirmed
positively that the penalty was only inflicted when
all hope was over of persuading the “heretics” to
recognise their error, and save their bodies as well
as their souls; and that every effort was made to
give them the opportunity of doing so. Given
More’s premises, the conclusion that their death
would tend to the salvation of other souls was
irresistible.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of 1529 that Wolsey was
struck down, and More, very much against his will,
was elevated to the Chancellorship. For a commoner
and a layman to receive the appointment was almost
revolutionary&mdash;at least it was a very signal mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of the depression of the nobility, although it was
many a year since any but an ecclesiastic had held
the office. In everything, More proved himself a
notably admirable occupant of the post, dealing
out justice with unprecedented despatch; not
only without allowing himself to be corrupted, in
which he was not unique, but also without accepting
those substantial compliments from suitors which
less rigidly scrupulous judges were in the habit of
profiting by, even when they did not allow their
decisions to be affected. No personal or professional
considerations were ever permitted by him to interfere
with the ends of justice, the most exact that
it was in his power to achieve. But his tenure of the
Chancellorship was brief. More was unique in
many respects, and in his own day he was unique
in refusing to retain office when he could no longer
do so without violating his conscience&mdash;without
making himself a party to a policy which he held to
be wrong. Other men shifted the responsibility
on to the king; More felt that the responsibility
could not be shifted, and in 1532 he resigned.</p>

<p>The cause of the resignation was Henry’s ecclesiastical
policy; its immediate occasion, the submission
of the clergy. The fall of Wolsey was
simultaneous with the summoning of the famous
“Seven Years” or “Reformation” Parliament of
Henry VIII. The king had given no sort of sign of
any disposition to relax the severity of his attitude
towards heresy; but as the months and years
passed, it became increasingly evident that his rigid
orthodoxy was to be accompanied by a prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
anti-clerical and anti-Papal campaign, the meaning
whereof was to be revealed only by degrees. A
twelvemonth had barely passed when the clergy
were suddenly notified that they had as a body been
guilty of a breach of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Præmunire</i> in accepting the
Legatine authority of Wolsey, and this was followed
up by requiring Convocation to affirm that the king
was sole and Supreme Protector and Head of the
Church. No new authority was directly claimed
for the Crown&mdash;without reading between the lines;
though it was tolerably clear that a good deal more
might be read into the declaration. The clergy
yielded. Then the Commons presented their supplication
against the ordinaries. The subsequent
operations showed that the Royal Supremacy was
to be applied after quite a new fashion. The clergy
yielded to the logic of force, and made their “submission.”
More, holding that no layman, king or
not, could by any possibility be rightfully head of
the Church in this new sense, concluded that he had
no alternative but to retire into private life.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">INDIGNATIO PRINCIPIS</span></h3>

<p>The divorce was Henry’s first objective; it was
duly pronounced by the new Archbishop in the
following spring. The step, however, was intensely
unpopular. The more clearly this was brought home
to the king’s mind, the more anxious he became to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
have the avowed support of every one whose opinion
carried weight. Irritation reached its climax over the
affair of the “Nun of Kent,” a young woman named
Elizabeth Barton, who had for some little time been
posing as a sort of prophetess. How far she believed
in her own imposture it is not possible to tell, but
she was certainly exploited by fanatical adherents
of the Papacy, and when she took to denouncing
the wrath of God against the king for the divorce,
there was a real risk that the superstition of the day
would make her ravings dangerous. There were
two men whom no persuasions had prevailed upon
to pronounce in favour of the Boleyn marriage&mdash;Fisher
of Rochester and Sir Thomas More. It was
found that both had had some sort of dealings with
the nun. Henry determined that they should both
suffer as her accomplices, unless they would openly
range themselves with his supporters. But the case
against More was so hopelessly futile that the king’s
advisers warned him that the ex-Chancellor’s inclusion
in the Bill of Attainder could only result
in the Bill itself being thrown out. His name was
therefore removed, to the great rejoicing of his
friends. More saw farther into the king’s mind
than they did. “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quod defertur non aufertur</i>,” he
said to his daughter.</p>

<p>He was right. The king and Cromwell were
ready to go to the last extremity to force the two
recalcitrants into line. An Act had been passed,
fixing the succession to the throne on the children
of Anne Boleyn. The ratification of the marriage
had led him to remark to Roper: “God give grace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
son, that these matters be not in a while confirmed
with oaths.” The Act of Succession carried with it
authority to impose an oath to maintain it; but
the oath subsequently formulated was so worded
as to bind the subscriber to the admission of the
invalidity of the marriage with Katharine, and the
denial of the Papal authority. The oath was
proffered to More and Fisher; both refused it,
though both were ready to maintain the succession.
Both were sent to the Tower.</p>

<p>It was in fact more than doubtful whether the
Act warranted the imposition of the oath in the
prescribed form. The imprisonment of the culprits
without trial was in any case illegal, and every
attempt to persuade them to yield failed. The King
always preferred to have the letter of the law on
his side; and it was impossible to pretend that
the refusal to subscribe involved treason. To give
their destruction a legal colour, a fresh Act of Succession
was passed at the end of the year (1534), expressly
confirming the form of the oath; and this
was accompanied by an Act of Supremacy, making
it treason to refuse to affirm the Royal Supremacy.
After that, it was simple enough to send More and
Fisher to their doom. To deny the Supremacy was
one thing; More had abstained from that. To
refuse to affirm it was another; More had always
done so. He maintained his position, and was
condemned to death as a traitor, under the law
which had been framed expressly to enmesh him.
His defence was only that the law itself was invalid
as being against the law of Christendom, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
liberties of the Church as affirmed in <i>Magna Charta</i>;
which of course the judges could not admit. A
week later, on July 6&mdash;the Eve of St. Thomas (of
Canterbury)&mdash;1535, Sir Thomas More was beheaded.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">CHARACTER AND DEATH</span></h3>

<p>Thanks mainly to the charm of the biography by
his son-in-law, William Roper, the private life and
character of Thomas More are among the most
familiar to us in history. It is a life good to dwell
upon, sweet and wholesome. Even in its public
aspects there is but the single note that jars, his
harshness&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">molestia</i> he called it&mdash;towards the heretics,
whom he classed with homicides and robbers: in
its domestic aspects it is wholly charming. In his
private capacity he could love even a heretic. Roper
himself, the sympathetic husband of his favourite
daughter Margaret, was bitten with Lutheran
doctrines, which even the persuasiveness of his
revered father-in-law could not induce him to relinquish.
To the error, as he deemed it, which was not
accompanied by propagandism, More was as tender
as could be desired. “Meg,” he said to Mistress
Roper, “I have borne long with thy husband; I
have reasoned long time with him, and still given
him my fatherly counsel; but I perceive none of
this can call him home again. And therefore, Meg,
I will no longer dispute with him, nor yet will I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
him over, but I will go another way to work, and get
me to God and pray for him.”</p>

<p>There we have the natural Thomas More, obeying
the kindly dictates of his own heart, which held no
rancour towards any one who had not in some sort
constituted himself an enemy of the “weal publick.”
Personal hostility to himself he held of no account.
Shortly before he was made Lord Chancellor, an old
servant of his came to him in great indignation
against some merchants who had been “liberally
rayling” at More. Would he not, seeing what his
favour was with the king, punish these scurrilous
people as they deserved? But More’s reply was
a very sound piece of philosophy in his usual humorous
vein&mdash;“Would you have me punish them by
whome I receave more benefitt than by you all that
be my friends? Lett them a God’s name speake
as lewedly as they list of me, and shoote never soe
many arrowes at me, so long as they do not hitt me,
what am I the worse? But if they should once hitt
me, then would it a little trouble me. Howbeit,
I trust by Gode’s helpe, there shall none of them all
be able once to touch me. I have more cause, I
assure thee, to pittie them than to be angrie with
them.”</p>

<p>We are told much of his simple piety and faith.
The same ardently reverent spirit, which made him
cling to the Church and uphold her authority, at
one time very nearly sent him into the cloister, and
did cause him to retain so much of the ascetic tradition
that he wore a hair-shirt next his skin all his
days; though it was only by accident that any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
save his beloved “Meg,” Margaret Roper, became
aware of the fact. His subjugation of the flesh
was free from its too common accompaniment of
arrogant or morbid austerity. It was little more
than an avoidance of insidious and apparently
harmless temptations, an appreciation of the unimportance
of gratifying physical appetites. He
reaped his reward. The sudden descent from ample
wealth to a narrow income, involved in his resignation
of the Chancellorship, had no terrors for him.
He had tried hard fare at Oxford, less hard at New
Inn, something better at Lincoln’s Inn. He and
his family could very well live by the Lincoln’s Inn
standard. If they found that too high for the
reduced exchequer, there was the New Inn standard
to fall back on, and after that the Oxford standard.
And even after that “May we yeat with bagges and
walletts go a-begging togither ... and soe still
keepe companie merrily together.” A cheery
philosophy.</p>

<p>Two of Roper’s anecdotes show, in the dramatic
touches which bring a very living Duke of Norfolk
before us, how the son-in-law profited by his father-in-law’s
example; besides illustrating More’s quaint
combination of seriousness and humour. The duke
went to see him about his resignation, at Chelsea,
and found him singing in the Church choir. “To
whome after service, as they went home togither
arme in arme, the duke said, ‘God body, God body,
my L<sup>d</sup>. Chancellor, a parish Clarke, a parish Clarke,
you dishonour the King and his office.’ ‘Nay,’
quoth Sir Thomas Moore smilinge upon the Duke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
‘your Grace may not thinke, that the Kinge your
Master and myne, will with me for serving God his
Master be offended, or thereby count his office
dishonoured.’” And again, when he had escaped
the Bill of Attainder: “The Duke sayd unto him,
‘By the masse, Mr. Moore, it is perillous strivinge
with Princes, and therefore I would wish you somewhat
to inclyne to the Kinge’s pleasure. For by
Gode’s body Mr. Moore <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Indignatio principis mors
est</i>.’ ‘Ys that all, my Lord?’ quoth he. ‘Is there
in good fayth noe more difference betweene your
Grace and me but that I shall dye to day and you
tomorrow?’”</p>

<p>But in the last days, the never-failing humour
has an exquisitely pathetic setting.</p>

<p>The worthy wife, “somewhat worldlie too,”
comes to see her husband in the Tower; she cannot
understand why he is so silly as to stop there, when
he might so easily recover the king’s goodwill by
doing “as all the Busshopps and best learned of
this realm have done.” He listens placidly to the
outburst, then: “I pray thee, good Mistress Alice,
tell me one thing: is not this house as nighe heaven
as mine own?” We are reminded of the last words
Humphrey Gilbert was heard to utter before the
<i>Squirrel</i> foundered: “We are as near God by sea
as by land.” But there was no one to reply to
Gilbert as “shee, after her accustomed fashion,
not likeinge such talke, answeared <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tille valle,
tille valle</i>.” The good soul has no patience for such
incomprehensible folly. Margaret Roper visits him,
the darling daughter, of all his children the likest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
him in wit and in person; with her he is sure of
perfect sympathy. She knows that his doom is
absolutely certain, nor is she one to dissuade him
from following the dictates of his conscience. After
the sentence in Westminster Hall, she is waiting at
the Tower wharf for the last fond farewell, the parting
blessing. Heedless of spectators, she darts through
the press of halberdiers guarding the prisoner, to
fling herself on his neck, pour out her tears and her
love on his breast. He soothes her with words of
tender counsel and affection. At last she tears
herself away, but overcome with the passion of
devotion, “suddenlye turned back againe, and rann
to him as before, tooke him about the necke, and
divers times togeather most lovingely kissed him,
and at last with a full heavie harte was fayne to
separate from him: the behouldinge whereof was
to manye of them that were present thereat soe
lamentable that it made them for very sorrow to
mourne and weepe.”</p>

<p>Shall we wonder at such love for the man who on
receiving sentence could say to his judges, as reported
by Anthony St. Leger, “I verily trust and
right heartily pray that though your lordships have
now in earth been Judges to my condemnation, we
may yet hereafter in heaven merrily all meet together
to our everlasting salvation”; whose spirit was so
imperturbable in its serenity, that it looked upon
death as a mere casual episode which in no wise
ruffled his habitual humour. “I pray you, Mr.
Lieutenant,” he said, with his foot on the scaffold,
noticing how ill it had been put together, “see me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
safe up. For my coming down, let me shift for
myself”: and as he laid his neck on the block,
moving his beard aside, “Pity that should be cut;
it hath committed no treason.”</p>

<p>His head, according to custom, was set on Temple
Bar, but Margaret Roper, she “who clasped in her
last trance her murdered father’s head,” was allowed
to obtain possession of it, and preserved it in spices
till her own death. The news of the execution was
conveyed to Charles V. His comment is endorsed
by posterity&mdash;“If we had been master of such a
servant, we would rather have lost the best city
of our dominions than have lost such a worthy

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">THOMAS CROMWELL</span></h3>

<p>For six years, Thomas Cromwell was palpably and
unmistakably the ruler of England&mdash;subject to the
approval of the king. For the four years preceding,
it is practically certain that he both suggested and
organised Henry’s policy. England has never known
a statesman so irresistible, so relentless, while his
power lasted; nor one whose downfall was more
sudden or so universally applauded. He is the most
terrifying because he is the most passionless figure
in our history. He wrought like fate, with a perfect
disregard of all human sentiment and emotion;
a scourge of God. Not, however, a mere scourge like
the earthquake and the pestilence; not a mere
destroyer; for, while he shattered, he built. But
for Cromwell, it may be doubted whether Elizabeth’s
England could have come into being.</p>

<p>For a second time Henry VIII. found the man
most consummately fitted to minister to his own
ambition; to plan, to organise, to smite&mdash;and to
be smitten. As Wolsey, having accomplished his
work, fell because he failed to engineer his master’s
matrimonial projects, so Cromwell, having accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
his work, fell in attempting to engineer a
matrimonial project which displeased his master.
Both the great ministers were men of humble birth
at the best: popular report gave out that the father
of the one was a butcher, that of the other a blacksmith.
The one mounted to power, the last and
perhaps the greatest product of the old relation
between Church and State; the other was the first
layman who, lacking even gentle blood, achieved the
highest position in the State, and shattered her old
relation with the Church. The reign of Henry VIII.
abounds in huge ironies: it is not perhaps the least
of them that the Hammer of the Monks passed into
the service of the king from the service of the Cardinal.</p>

<p>Diversities in the judgments passed on Thomas
Cromwell are less marked than in the case of most of
the statesmen portrayed in this volume. There is
no possibility of questioning the utter absence of
moral scruple in the methods by which he pursued
his ends, the completeness with which he subordinated
every other consideration to their achievement, the
vast organising power he displayed. That he was
actuated by a moral repulsion to the Roman system,
or a religious enthusiasm for the purity of the Gospel,
is a view that can only be put forward on the sweeping
assumption that everybody concerned in the
Reformation at all was so actuated, except feeble or
wicked bigots who clung to the old order. Cromwell
as a Protestant Martyr is very much like Frederic
the Great as Protestant Hero. Every one who
believes that it was good for England to reject the
Papal authority and to subordinate the Church in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
England to the State, is bound to consider that the
man who did these things for England rendered his
country a great service. Every one who holds the
contrary view as to the Papacy and the Church must
hold that he rendered her almost immeasurable
dis-service. But these are judgments not on the
man but on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Yet there is one very curious fact about Thomas
Cromwell. Although he set his mark indelibly on
the history of his country, and in spite of the
exceptionally dramatic course of his career, his name
seems to convey very little to most Englishmen&mdash;save
as the secretary whom Wolsey charged to
“fling away ambition.” Oliver looms so large that
it is difficult to grasp the idea that another person
of the same name also loomed large a hundred years
earlier. No playwright or novelist has made him
a central figure in drama or novel. Yet it may at
least be argued that of the ten characters here
examined, his personality was the one which most
decisively influenced the course of history.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">EARLIER CAREER AND RISE TO POWER</span></h3>

<p>In the last quarter of the fifteenth century there
was dwelling in Putney one Walter Cromwell, alias
Smyth, who appears to have been a brewer, smith,
and armourer, and incidentally to have been a very
troublesome person with a taste for breaking the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in minor matters. There is no doubt that Walter
was the father of Thomas: whose birth conjecture
places about 1485. Down to 1512, the accounts
of Cromwell’s life rest entirely on later gossip,
sometimes professedly derived from remarks which
he himself let fall. All reports, however, agree in
saying that he went to Italy when very young&mdash;“fleeing
from his father,” one of them avers. It
needs no evidence to show that he had a remarkably
enterprising and self-reliant spirit, and if he did run
away from a turbulent parent to seek his fortune
by his wits, it was a course thoroughly consonant
with his subsequent career. The reports state
further that he served as a man-at-arms under an
Italian nobleman, and with the French in 1503.
Allowing for presumable inaccuracies of detail,
there is no reason to doubt that he tried his hand
as a trader of sorts in the Low Countries and in
Italy. There is, however, definite ground for believing
that he returned to England about 1512, and
married the next year. If Mistress Elizabeth Wykeys
did not bring something fairly handsome in the way
of a fortune, Thomas Cromwell must have strangely
forgotten himself. For some years, it may be
affirmed with confidence that he took part in business
as a wool-merchant or “shearman,” combining
this trade with practice as an attorney. Documentary
evidence puts it effectively beyond doubt that
he was professionally known as a man of law to
Wolsey in 1520. In 1523 he sat in the House of
Commons as a Member of that Parliament which,
under Sir Thomas More’s Speakership, declined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
discuss the voting of a subsidy in the Cardinal’s
presence.</p>

<p>By this time we are getting away from the region
of conjecture, anecdote, and hearsay, into that of
definite records. What we know of Cromwell’s
share in this Parliament is derived from two documents;
one, a letter of his own, in which he gibes
at his fellow members for having babbled at large
about everything under the sun without doing
anything. “I have endured,” he says, “a Parliament
which continued by the space of seventeen
whole weeks, where we communed of war, peace,
strife, contention, debate, murmur, grudge, riches,
poverty, penury, truth, falsehood, justice, equity,
deceit, oppression, magnanimity, activity, force,
temperance, treason, murder, felony, and also how
a commonwealth might be edified and continued
within our realm. Howbeit, in conclusion we have
done as our predecessors have been wont to do; that
is to say, as well as we might, and left where we began.’
If Carlyle had lighted upon that, how his heart would
have rejoiced! The second document, however,
suggests that if Cromwell, like Carlyle, had no great
opinion of talkers, he meant his own voice to be
heard: since it is almost certainly the MS. draft of
a speech which he prepared for delivery in that same
Parliament. The speech is exceedingly clever, and
most diplomatically expressed&mdash;but is dead against
Wolsey’s subsidy. Perhaps he thought better of it,
and kept it in MS. If not, it was an audacious speech
to make, for a man who was getting in touch with
the Cardinal, from whose good graces much might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
be hoped. Still, a like audacity paid him well
some six years later. It may have been carefully
calculated in both instances; but in both there
were big risks.@</p>

<p>At any rate, his favour with the great minister
increased. He dropped his wool-business, extended
his private legal practice, was entrusted with much
legal work by the Cardinal, and became known as
the person through whom suitors to Wolsey might
find it advisable to make their applications. It was
not long before he found, in his capacity as a man
of law, congenial employment in the suppression
of small religious Houses, and the appropriation of
their endowments to Wolsey’s colleges at Ipswich
and Oxford. This business he did to the entire
satisfaction of his master; and since he never at
any time hesitated to accept or extract material
contributions to his private exchequer from any one
concerned, his accumulations grew <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</i> with
his favour. So also, incidentally, did his unpopularity,
for which he cared absolutely nothing. His
confidential relations with the apparently all-powerful
minister made him a person of considerable
though unofficial importance; bringing him in
contact with people of high position. Thus in 1527
he was well-known to Reginald Pole (afterwards
Cardinal), whom he counselled to drop high-flown
ideas, and learn the practical business of a politician
by studying Machiavelli’s “Prince”&mdash;a work of which
he must have obtained a MS. copy, as it had not yet
been printed, though written probably as early as
1513.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
But the toils of the divorce business were already
enmeshing Cromwell’s patron; as the year 1529
advanced, clouds, lightning-charged, were gathering
over his head, and the secretary knew that the hour
was about to strike when he himself must either
“make or mar.”</p>

<p>We have seen that practically nothing is known
with absolute certainty as to Cromwell’s early years;
we have seen also that the reports about that period
of his life are sufficiently consistent with each other
and with his later career to warrant us in assuming
that they were tolerably well grounded. It would be
difficult to conceive of any man thus trained, turning
out otherwise than a cynic. At home, we have the
father, a man in a respectable position, who is, however,
eternally being summonsed for some breach of
the law. The clever and independent youngster
quarrels with his father, and takes himself off to
foreign parts. He makes for Italy&mdash;the land of all
others where brains counted most; the land also
where morals counted least; the land <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>
of poison and poniards; the land where every one
was formally orthodox, and hardly any one&mdash;least
of all the priests&mdash;believed anything much. Only
a religious enthusiast could pass through the ordeal
of life in Italy&mdash;at the age of twenty or thereabouts&mdash;without
becoming a sceptic. That a Cromwell
should have passed through it without conceiving
a most heart-felt contempt for the whole Roman
system would be incredible; but it is hardly more
credible that he should have been converted into a
cold, stern moralist. If he was, he kept the cold, stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
morality pretty thoroughly in abeyance until it
found vent in the destruction of the monasteries.</p>

<p>After a brief experience of life in camp and in the
guard-room, the young man is apparently for some
ten years knocking about from Venice to Antwerp,
acquiring a sound knowledge of trade and a mastery
of the ways of traders. Then he returns to England
and turns his knowledge to account, combining with
it a lucrative practice, as a presumably somewhat
unscrupulous but amazingly clever attorney. Always
it is the seamy side of life which concerns him; and
at any rate, after he has sown his wild oats and
acquired experience, he adds to the conviction that
most men would be knaves if they could, the certainty
that, at least in comparison with Thomas Cromwell,
most of them are fools. This consciousness makes
him ambitious. He manages to attract the great
Cardinal’s attention by his abilities. The summoning
of a Parliament gives him an opportunity. He
prepares a speech for it, which will certainly make
him a man of some mark if it is delivered&mdash;and a
clever speech in opposition, as many parliamentarians
learned when Parliament had become a real power,
is not always an obstacle to government favour.
Cromwell is still a man of the people, and the speech
is on the people’s side. Whether he made that
speech pay him by delivering it or by suppressing it
remains uncertain&mdash;either is possible. Anyhow,
from that date his favour and his prosperity
advanced rapidly; his thorough knowledge of law,
of business, and of character, and his immense
mastery of detail, making him a quite invaluable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
servant. And he who has become invaluable to the
first minister of the Court may become invaluable
to the Court itself.</p>

<p>Now what would be the natural political attitude
of such a man? Had there been room for a career
as a demagogue when he sat in the Parliament of
1523, he might have adopted that <i>rôle</i>: aiming, of
course, at a dictatorship. But there was no opening.
To such a man, however, it is quite certain that the
absolute rule of one man would present itself as the
sole really strong form of government. Absolutism
was taking the place of the old Feudalism all over
Europe; Henry VII. had laid sure foundations for
it in England; Wolsey had carried on the work;
it would be the business of Wolsey’s successor to
complete it. The political theory of Machiavelli
was not in itself novel; it must have been familiar,
as a latent theory, to every one who knew anything
of the Italy of the Medicis and the Borgias. The
novelty lay in stating it boldly in the open. That,
even the author of the “Prince” had not done as
yet: he had merely formulated it for private circulation.
Publication was deferred. But the Machiavellian
creed had reached the hands of Wolsey’s
secretary, who had adopted it with complete appreciation.
Its central tenets are the complete divorce
between ethical considerations and political methods,
and the complete concentration of all power under
the control of one will. The “Prince” became
Cromwell’s political text-book, whose principles and
maxims he was prepared to apply with appalling
thoroughness if ever the opportunity offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
It was remarked that before the appointment of
Sir Thomas More in 1529, no one had held the office
of Lord Chancellor unless he was either of noble birth
or an ecclesiastic. More, however, was of gentle
blood. It required a yet more violent departure
from precedent for the king to take as his own most
confidential adviser a layman of plebeian origin;
and some considerable time elapsed before Cromwell
held openly the position which in effect had already
long been his. The story of his elevation will occupy
the section now following: here we have attempted
to present the figure of the man who in the autumn
of 1529 was nothing more than the confidential
secretary of a minister who was on the very verge
of the historic “farewell to all his greatness.” The
secretary presents in many respects a very marked
contrast to his master, but the contrast with his
master’s successor in the Chancellorship is still more
striking. England never knew a statesman whose
politics were so entirely ethical as More; never
one who ignored ethics so completely as Cromwell.
With the one, conscience stood unmistakeably first;
with the other it was non-existent, as far as state-craft
was concerned. That is not to say that the man
himself was without conscience or moral sense;
just as Machiavelli, his master, was the last statesman
in Italy who could be called a scoundrel.
Cromwell held with Machiavelli that the political
end justifies any means; the only question for the
statesman is, whether in the particular instance a
flagrantly immoral method may frustrate the end
sought instead of furthering it, by shocking sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
which require to be conciliated. The Italian
would not personally practise all that he preached:
his English disciple went farther. Both doctrine
and practice were the direct contradictions of the
doctrine and practice of Thomas More.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">PLANNING THE CAMPAIGN</span></h3>

<p>The blow fell: the Cardinal was struck suddenly
down. What did Cromwell do? In effect, we
have two authorities&mdash;Cavendish, Wolsey’s honest
but not over astute biographer, and Foxe, honest too,
but ready to believe whatever chimed in best with his
own theories. On Hallowmass Day, November 1,
Cavendish found the secretary in the Great Chamber
at Esher, whither the fallen Cardinal had retired;
in much perturbation of spirit over the prospect of
his own ruin for his faithful service to Wolsey, and
resolved, in his own phrase, to go up to London,
and “make or mar.” He did not desert his master,
but he went up to London and made haste to commend
himself to the other side. He played his
cards boldly, bidding directly for the favour of
Norfolk, with whose approbation he forthwith
entered the newly-called Parliament as member
for Taunton. In fact, he had the wit to recognise
that by skilful management he could be loyal to
Wolsey and push his own prospects at the same time.
The move was audacious, and successful. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
three possible courses. A baser or a less astute
man would have tried to win favour with his master’s
enemies by turning and rending his master. A less
daring one would have carefully dropped out of
sight, taking his chance of being able some day
to retrieve his position. Cromwell was bold enough
to take up the cudgels openly in defence of the
Cardinal, thereby winning much credit for courage
and loyalty: at the same time, retaining the fallen
minister’s confidence. Thus he was also enabled
to manœuvre for Wolsey, and to mollify some of
his enemies by judicious presents, bestowed under
his advice and direction&mdash;and passing through his
hands. There is no need to discredit either the
loyalty or the courage displayed, but there is no
denying that in displaying it he served his own
interests better than he could have done in any other
way.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s public defence of the Cardinal did not
in fact mean much more than active opposition in
Parliament to the Bill of Attainder; and Henry,
at any rate, was not thirsting for Wolsey’s blood.
It was probably some time before he quite made
up his mind that he could do better without the
man who had done so much for him. It is not
unlikely that what ultimately decided him was the
growing perception that he could make the combination
of Cromwell and Cranmer serve his turn
more effectively. He had just caught from the
Cambridge Doctor the idea of discarding the Papal
jurisdiction in the divorce in favour of the National
Ecclesiastical Courts supported by the opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the qualified University doctors of Europe. There
is very little doubt that one of the first steps taken
by Cromwell was to obtain an interview with the
king, nominally to defend himself against the malice
of the Cardinal’s enemies; and that he turned the
interview to account by hinting pretty openly that
he could work out for the king a policy which would
not only ensure the divorce, but bring him much
profit in other ways, making him “the richest king
that ever was in England,” says Chapuys, the
emperor’s ambassador.</p>

<p>Now Henry’s was not the type of mind which
invents large and far-reaching schemes of political
action; but it was the type which can appreciate
and appropriate a big scheme designed by some one
else. Hitherto, until he became awake to the idea
that Clement, under pressure from the emperor,
might actually deny him the divorce, there is no
reason to suppose that he had ever dreamt of quarrelling
with the Papacy as an institution, or with the
ecclesiastical body in England. Recently things
had looked as if there might be a serious personal
quarrel with Clement, of a kind for which there
were precedents, and Stephen Gardiner had used
distinctly threatening expressions in that sense to
his Holiness. Wolsey’s difficulties had been largely
due to his anxiety lest the divorce should lead to
something still more serious; but that had been
all. Now, however, Wolsey was hardly displaced
when the first moves were made in what was revealed
later as a huge campaign, directed in the first instance
against clerical abuses, extending to privileges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
finally absorbing property; in the course of which
every pretension of the Holy See to jurisdiction,
authority or tribute in the realm of England was flatly
and decisively repudiated.</p>

<p>The whole thing worked out in its successive
stages with such systematic precision that there
is no room for doubt of its having been completely
planned from a very early stage. Throughout,
Henry identified himself with it thoroughly. But
it is almost inconceivable that he should have had
any such plan in his head when he was making Sir
Thomas More his Chancellor, and Norfolk to all
appearance his principal counsellor. On the other
hand, the scheme is precisely such a one as would
have formed in the brain of the student of Machiavelli
who felt himself to be the one man who was
able and willing to carry it out in the king’s service.
The old Baronage was already hardly dangerous;
a very few judicious blows would make it utterly
incapable of organised resistance; but if the English
ecclesiastical body, with its great corporate wealth,
worked in harmonious accord with the Papacy,
under skilful leadership, in opposition to the Crown,
the Crown might not get the best of the conflict.
With the Church brought to heel in England, itself
severed from the Papacy, and its wealth in the grip
of the sovereign, the royal will would be irresistible.
To suggest this new policy to the king, with himself
as the instrument to put it in execution, not perhaps
all at once, but enough at a time to carry the king
along with him, would be a stroke which could
hardly fail of success; especially as, in enumerating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the advantages the policy offered, the certainty of
getting the desired divorce could be placed in the
forefront. Henry could be perfectly relied upon
to see his own advantage in the proposal; he was
equally certain to recognise in the designer of the
scheme the qualities needed for carrying it out.
Everything points to Cromwell, not Henry, as the
deviser. The only alternative is, that Henry had
already made his plan, but only began to regard it
as practicable after he had guessed at and tested
Cromwell’s capacities as an instrument; a very
much less probable hypothesis on the face of it.
Moreover, it is quite certain that neither before 1529
nor after 1540 did Henry show any power of creating
out of his own head a deeply considered and far-reaching
policy. When he was left to himself, or
when he went counter to Wolsey or Cromwell, he
never showed himself a statesman who naturally
took “long views.”</p>

<p>Cromwell, then, is to be regarded not as the able
and unscrupulous instrument chosen by Henry to
carry out his own preconceived design of revolutionising
the relations between the secular sovereign,
the Church in England, and the Papal authority.
Henry had the ability to appreciate and to adopt
the plan, but the brain which both conceived and
organised it, as well as the hand which executed it,
belonged not to the king but to the minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">CONTRA ECCLESIAM</span></h3>

<p>It does not in effect militate against this view,
that before Cromwell could have set any agency in
motion, Parliament did itself lead the way by attacking
certain minor and universally recognised abuses,
without waiting for Convocation to deal with them.
It needed nothing in the way of a campaign to ensure
reforms being demanded and approved where the
clergy themselves admitted that the existing state
of things was scandalous. The first real blow was
struck some months after Cromwell had obtained
the king’s ear, when Convocation, towards the close
of 1530, was startled by a message that the whole
of the clergy had offended against the Statute of
Præmunire in admitting the Legatine authority of
the deceased Cardinal. That authority had of course
been sanctioned by the approval of the king; but
the fact that it was illegal was not thereby altered.
Technically, there was no possibility of evading the
charge. The clergy had broken the law; they
must pay the penalty. They did, fining themselves
to the tune of a million or so of our money. If they
had not been perfectly helpless, the impudence of
the demand, coming from the king, would have been
simply colossal: but a demand which cannot be
gainsaid can hardly be called impudent. Wolsey,
of course, had been penalised for exercising the
authority, but then there was the superficial excuse
that he had obtained his master’s sanction by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
beguiling his unsuspecting innocence. Here the
king could not even produce that flimsy excuse.</p>

<p>This financial operation, however, struck the
keynote of the Cromwellian policy. Wolsey had
over-ridden the law in procuring the Legatine
appointment: he had sought to do so by demanding
Benevolences: he had sought to do so by overawing
Parliament. Now, everything was to be done under
form of law. Even if&mdash;unwittingly of course&mdash;the
authorities transgressed their legal powers, the transgression
was to be regularised by a statute <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad hoc</i>.
The principle was equally agreeable to the tender
conscience of Henry and the legal proclivities of his
minister.</p>

<p>The huge fine, however, did not satisfy the requirements.
Convocation, in passing the Bill, was compelled
to pass also a clause acknowledging the king
as the “Only Supreme Head” of the Church, though
it was allowed to introduce the qualifying phrase “so
far as the law of Christ permits.” Except as an
ingenious salve to clerical consciences, the qualification
was futile, since, in the exercise of his supremacy,
Henry would certainly not admit that he was going
farther than those laws permitted, and he would also
be the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> judge on the question if any one
should dare to raise it. The whole clause might be
interpreted as meaning everything, or as meaning
nothing&mdash;but the king would be the interpreter.</p>

<p>The Bill, with the clause, was passed in 1531.
Again the campaign rested for about a year. So far,
apart from a slight rectification of abuses, nothing
more&mdash;in form&mdash;had been done than to exact from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the clergy a penalty to which they had rendered
themselves technically liable, and to demand from
them the formal admission of what was asserted to
be already the constitutional position of the Crown
in relation to them. In theory there had been
nothing in the nature of innovation. Now, it was
time for innovation; so Parliament had to be called
in, as against the Church. But the innovation was
to threaten the Papal claims, so the Church must
share the responsibility. Thus a fresh phase of the
campaign opened with the beginning of 1532.</p>

<p>Again there were in the first place obvious abuses
which were dealt with under Acts concerning mortmain
and benefit of clergy. These, of themselves,
implied nothing in particular. But it was a very
different thing with the Annates Act: the first
direct and manifest challenge of a Papal claim. Rome
had claimed from every bishop on his appointment
to a See the whole of the first year’s revenue. This,
as the Act pointed out, was a very grievous burden
on the bishops, for whose relief this system was to
be stopped. Until quite recently, it has never been
disputed that this Bill was introduced in response
to the actual petition of Convocation. That idea
was based on the existence of a document which&mdash;closer
examination leaves no doubt&mdash;did not proceed
from Convocation at all, as had hitherto been
supposed. Chapuys reported at the time that the
bishops opposed the measure. By this time, doubtless,
the supremacy business had awakened their
alarm, and others besides Fisher were beginning to
dread a rupture with the Papacy. There are however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
two special features which demand our attention.
The Bill was framed ostensibly for the relief of the
clergy, implying that the Crown, not the Papacy,
was the true protector of their interests, and emphasising
an antagonism between English Churchmen
and the Pope. Also, it was not required to be put
in immediate execution, but was to be held in suspense
during the king’s pleasure. A double purpose was
served thereby, though the intention was masked.
Clement could buy the withdrawal of the measure
by conceding the divorce: while if he should elect
to close that door to reconciliation, it would not be
too late to divert the annates into the king’s
pocket, instead of abolishing the impost. The
clergy would be none the better in either event, but
the trick would have helped to keep them on the
king’s side till it was too late to change. Henry was
still playing for a divorce with the Papal sanction;
he had not come to regard a final breach with the
Papacy as an end desirable <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>. Cromwell, we
may assume, took a different view, but of course
could not dream of forcing Henry’s hand: what he
could do was to have everything in thorough order
for a decisive breach, if and when the moment should
come.</p>

<p>There was something more, however, for Parliament
to do, namely its presentation of the Supplication
against the Ordinaries. There is no doubt at
all that in every essential this was Cromwell’s
personal handiwork. It was a double-barrelled
attack, from the popular point of view, on the way
in which the Church exercised its jurisdiction; from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the sovereign’s point of view, on the authority of
the Church’s legislation. The whole intention of it
was to force the clergy as a body to admit that their
authority, whether as individuals or as a corporate
body, was subordinate to that of the sovereign. Its
object was attained with entire success: it resulted
in what was known as the “Submission of the
Clergy,” virtually a complete surrender. The defeat
was practically the death-blow of the aged Archbishop
Warham; while the Lord Chancellor, Sir
Thomas More, found himself so totally opposed to
the principle involved that he resigned office and
went into retirement.</p>

<p>Warham’s death at this juncture was most convenient.
The old man had not been sufficiently
stout of heart to offer a stubborn resistance to the
new policy, but he had yielded with much misgiving
and soreness of spirit. He had been restive enough
to make it doubtful whether in the last resort he
might not decline to pronounce a judgment against
Katharine in defiance of the Pope. By appointing
Cranmer to the Archbishopric, Henry made sure of
a primate who would have no qualms on the point.
This security made him ready to precipitate the
crisis which the Pope was craving to postpone or
evade. The simple truth was that Clement felt
himself to be completely in the grip of the emperor,
and no conceivable threats from England could have
extracted the desired verdict from him. The fact
was unmistakeably revealed by the publication, in
February, of what was in effect an order to Henry
to re-instate Katharine on pain of excommunication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
The reply was the Act in Restraint of Appeals&mdash;in
form an Act declaratory of the existing law of
England, in effect an announcement of independence&mdash;immediately
followed by Cranmer’s judicial pronouncement
invalidating the marriage with Katharine
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab initio</i>. Until Clement retorted by declaring
Cranmer’s judgment void, Henry abstained from
confirming either the Act in Restraint of Appeals
or the Annates Act; their confirmation was his
rejoinder. After that, there might be talk of reconciliation,
but the practical possibility was gone past
recall.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FABRIC OF DESPOTISM</span></h3>

<p>The year 1533 may be regarded as marking the
irreparable breach with the Papacy, though it was not
till 1534 that Clement gave his own formal judgment
in favour of Katharine, and Convocation issued its
own declaration that the “Bishop of Rome” derives
from Scripture no more jurisdiction in England than
“any other foreign bishop”&mdash;two sentences which
may perhaps be regarded as merely bolting an already
locked door. The purpose of Cromwell’s anti-clerical
campaign was so far achieved that the
clergy had been driven out of their main strongholds
by their “submission,” and had next been cut off
from the aid of a Papal alliance. These were the
preliminary measures to the assertion in very
concrete guise of the untrammelled supremacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the Crown in things ecclesiastical and temporal
alike, which was the aim of the policy we have
ascribed primarily to Cromwell rather than his
master. An additional reason for so ascribing it
is to be found in the strong presumption afforded
by the evidence that Henry himself did not wish to
cast off the Papal allegiance utterly, until he found
that he could get the divorce in no other way.
Apart from his fixed resolution to make Anne Boleyn
his wife at all costs, it may be doubted if he reckoned
that the complication of foreign relations involved
in a final repudiation of the Pope’s authority would
be compensated by the more unqualified control
of ecclesiastical matters at home. For him the
divorce turned the scale: and since he could not
escape the disadvantages of revolting, he meant to
have every scrap of advantage that could be reaped
from it too. The differences which presently arose
between the king and his minister on the conduct of
foreign affairs will be found to have some bearing
on this view of the case.</p>

<p>At any rate, the breach being made, Henry was as
ready as Cromwell for aggression; and Cromwell was
let loose to carry out his policy&mdash;within the realm&mdash;to
the uttermost: no longer working in the background,
but in a position as openly dominant as
Wolsey himself had occupied.</p>

<p>The first business was to confirm formally the
positions already taken up, in a fresh series of Acts
of Parliament, in the early session of 1534; embodying
the recent measures, but generally carrying them
a step further. Thus “Peter Pence” were abolished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
as well as Annates. An appeal to the King’s Court
of Chancery from the Ecclesiastical Courts was substituted
for the Appeal to Rome abolished by the
Restraint of Appeals. The “submission of the
clergy” was extended so as to bring the whole
instead of a part only of the canon law under the
purview of the commission to be appointed for its
examination. The corollary of the Boleyn marriage
was an Act of Succession in favour of the offspring
of Anne: but the Act carried with it a murderous
sting. “I pray that these things be not confirmed
with oaths,” More had said when the marriage was
ratified. His anticipation was justified. An oath
of obedience to the Act was to be administered.</p>

<p>In this affair of the oath, we as usual find Henry
and Cromwell in perfect accord as to policy, but not
actuated by precisely the same motive. The thing
in Cromwell’s mind is the Royal Supremacy; he is
determined to be rid of conditions which check the
activities of the Crown, and of men whose influence
tends to keep alive doubts as to the Crown’s legitimate
powers. Henry’s point of view is the personal one.
He has done a very unpopular thing in divorcing
Katharine and marrying Anne, and is determined
to make every one admit that he was entirely in
the right. Now, there was in England no ecclesiastic
so universally esteemed for probity and
saintliness as Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester;
there was no layman who could compare for intellectual
eminence and beauty of character with
Thomas More. It was known to the world that both
these men held that Katharine’s marriage had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
valid, and that both disapproved the recent anti-Papal
developments. So also it was known that in
the Houses of Religion which stood highest in
reputation for sincerity and austerity, and were
untouched by the breath of scandal, the divorce
and the revolt were regarded with horror. To force
these recalcitrants openly to declare in favour of the
divorce and the Royal Supremacy, would be a great
triumph. On the other hand, nothing would so
terrorise opposition as the smiting down, before the
horrified eyes of the world, of victims so distinguished.
Cromwell therefore drafted the oath of obedience
to the Act of Succession in such terms that the
subscriber would have to swear not only loyalty to
the provisions of the Act, but acceptance of the
divorce as right, and of the Royal Supremacy as
theoretically sound. More, Fisher, and some of the
monks to whom the oath was administered, refused
to desert their principles. They would swear to
maintain the succession as laid down, since it lay
within the function of the State to order the succession;
but they would not take the oath as it stood.
Thereupon they were sent to prison.</p>

<p>It may readily be believed that the minister, as
reported, swore a great oath when he heard More’s
refusal. The moral effect of winning such converts
would have been incalculable: preferable certainly
to shocking public sentiment as the alternative course
must do. But he was not in the least afraid of shocking
public sentiment, at any rate if he at the same
time inspired terror; if circumstances demanded
victims, the more conspicuous they were, the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
For once, however, a point had been overlooked:
it appeared impossible lawfully to proceed to extremities
on the ground of refusal to take the oath.
The omission was rectified in the next session of
Parliament. In a fresh Act of Succession, the oath
as administered was expressly ratified, and the
occasion was seized to pass a new Treasons Act,
inadequately described as drastic. It was made
treason to question the titles of the queen and the
heirs apparent, or to impute heresy or schism to
the king; and the lawyers were able so to interpret
it that mere silence might be construed as treason&mdash;it
was enough to refuse to affirm the Supremacy
and the rest of it. The two new Acts were brought
to bear on the victims, who remained firm and were
executed in the following summer. There is no
shadow of a hint anywhere that Cromwell suffered
a single qualm in working out the destruction of
either More or Fisher, but it is hardly necessary to
make him responsible for the equally ruthless
attitude of the king. According to Roper’s circumstantial
narrative, Henry was so vindictive towards
More when once he had turned against him, that he
could hardly be persuaded to have him left out of
the Bill of Attainder in the affair of the Nun of Kent,
until the Chancellor, Lord Audley, and others
succeeded in convincing him that Parliament could
not possibly pass the Bill with More’s name included.
If ever there was a chance of life for Fisher and More,
it was destroyed when Henry’s fury was roused by
the new Pope making Fisher a Cardinal. These
facts illustrate the difference between Henry’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
attitude and Cromwell’s. To Cromwell, More and
Fisher are merely obstructions to his policy. They
must either cease to obstruct or be crushed. To
spare them for sentimental reasons would be absurd,
but there is no passion or vindictiveness or animosity
about their destruction, as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Never had any king of England wielded so deadly
an engine of despotism as was placed in Henry’s
hands by this Treasons Act of Cromwell; whereof,
however, the full force depended on its manipulation
by its designer. The country was in a very short
time so sown with the minister’s spies that the
moment any one became obnoxious to authority
it was the simplest thing possible to procure an information
of a hasty word spoken or passed by in
silence, of a phrase that might have carried a double
meaning; and the victim’s doom was virtually
sealed. The excuse, of course, was the one on which
a tyranny that seeks to justify itself invariably falls
back&mdash;that an unparalleled emergency demands
extraordinary powers. It was not, indeed, quite
obvious that there was an unparalleled emergency
in existence, but then it might arise at any moment.
Cromwell was going on to a series of measures which
might prove acceptable, but might on the other
hand provoke a storm of indignation. With the
Treasons Act ready to his hand, he could anticipate
conspiracy by striking wherever and whenever it
pleased him. It was an integral part of his political
theory that Government&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Despot&mdash;should
have that power. It was not, of course, aimed
specifically at the Church; it was only incidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
concerned with More and Fisher. The repression
of clericalism was only a part of the scheme for a
legalised Despotism. The climax, the theoretical
coping-stone of the edifice, was not achieved till the
Act which in 1539 gave Royal Proclamations the
force of law; but for practical purposes, the Treasons
Act made Henry a monarch more absolute than any
other in Christendom.</p>

<p>Cromwell, however, had not as yet fulfilled the
promise he is said to have given of making Henry
“the richest king that ever was in England.” As a
matter of fact, whatever riches had come in his way
Henry would never have kept a full treasury, since
he always emptied it with both hands. But Cromwell
in his capacity as Vicar-General, or representative
of the Supreme Head with unlimited powers&mdash;which
office was bestowed on him early in 1535, a
few months after the Treasons Act&mdash;was to make him
a record present. It was a matter of principle with
him, in his methods, to make rude display to the
higher clergy of the fact that they must now recognise
themselves as mere menials of the Crown, whose
functions might be superseded at the royal pleasure;
and on those lines he acted in striking his next
blow, sending out a commission of his own creatures
to “visit” the monasteries, and report upon
them. It is only necessary to recall one of his casual
memoranda at a later date&mdash;“Item, the Abbot of
Reading, to be sent down to be tried <i>and executed</i>”&mdash;to
feel properly satisfied that the case of the
monasteries was prejudged. The commission was
intended to report evil concerning them, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
good; and the commissioners acted up to their
instructions. It is quite possible that a perfectly
impartial tribunal after complete investigation would
have found the evidence hardly less damning; but
what the commissioners did was to pay a series of
hasty visits, collect all the scandal they could get
any one to retail to them, insult or frighten respectable
and responsible inmates till they gave confused
or evasive answers, or none at all, to interrogatories,
and so to produce what passed as evidence of a very
abominable and corrupt state of affairs. Whereupon
Parliament passed an Act dissolving between three
and four hundred Houses, in effect handing their
property over to the Crown. Some of this wealth
was theoretically appropriated to endowing new
bishoprics and to other corresponding purposes;
but in practice a fraction of it only was so utilised.
Some of the lands were given away to people whom
it was convenient for the king&mdash;or Cromwell&mdash;to
placate; most were sold at low prices&mdash;with the
effect of establishing a new landed proprietary which
in the years long after was to play a part in the
national politics which their creator can hardly
have foreseen. It was not Cromwell’s way to reach
for more than he could grasp; before he made one
stride, he had calculated for the next, but he did not
take it till his own time. So he did not wipe out
the monastic system at a blow. The completion
of the business waited&mdash;like the Royal Proclamations
Act&mdash;till 1539. For the present, Cromwell was
content to impose on the greater monasteries, and
such of the lesser ones as still survived, a disciplinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
code which professed to have in view the enforcement
of a becoming austerity, but was felt to be
so intolerably severe as effectually to bring about
several voluntary dissolutions or surrenders.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s royal partner, no doubt, in a famous
phrase of much later date, “stood amazed at his
own moderation.” But the country hardly took
the same view. The year which saw, in February,
the first Act dissolving the lesser monasteries, saw
also in the autumn a rising in Lincolnshire, very
shortly followed by the organised Yorkshire insurrection
known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. As in
all the religious rebellions of the Reformation, the
issues were a good deal mixed up with social discontents;
and the last straw was probably a piece
of Cromwell’s handiwork which had nothing to do
with ecclesiastical matters, being a measure known
as the Statute of Uses, designed to get rid of a maze
of legal complications which had arisen from ingenious
evasions of the law as to the inheritance of
land. The insurgents, however, put the religious
innovations in the forefront of their schedule of
grievances: openly demanding the dismissal of
both Cromwell and Cranmer. The military management
of the suppression of the rebellion was left to
the Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, but no collision
was allowed till the northern levies had been diplomatically
induced to disperse; after which some
sporadic outbreaks were used, after the turn of the
year, as an excuse for an extremely heavy-handed
exaction of retribution. Cromwell, however, turned
the whole thing to account; as certain abbots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
priors had been more or less deeply implicated,
whereby the opportunity was given for suppressing
several considerable religious communities, and hanging
some highly placed Churchmen. A further
result was the re-organisation of the government
of the counties constituting the Marches&mdash;those
which were always living with an eye on Scotland,
and enjoyed or suffered a special system of control&mdash;by
the establishment of a new Council of the North
which diminished the power of the nobility in those
regions; Cromwell always maintaining the same
end persistently in view, the weakening of all power
of organised resistance to the king’s will.</p>

<p>Another year brought another opportunity. In
1538, Cromwell discovered a conspiracy. The South-west
of England, like the North, was ever on what
may be called the Romantic side when developments,
political or religious, were in progress. It was now
perturbed over the innovations. It appeared that
the Marquis of Exeter, the king’s first cousin and
a grandson of Edward IV., was engaged in some
sort of conspiracy with the Poles, whose mother was
the old Countess of Salisbury, daughter of “false
fleeting perjured Clarence.” Amongst them, they
stood for the relics of the old Yorkist anti-Tudor
faction. Cromwell had already taken occasion to
warn Reginald Pole&mdash;whose diatribes against Henry,
issued from abroad, had brought him under the royal
ban&mdash;that his kinsmen in England might pay the
penalty for his audacity. Whether there was any
real body in the conspiracy is open to doubt, but
there was quite enough evidence to go upon under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the Treasons Act. The process by attainder practically
suppressed any defence. Exeter, Montague
(the head of the Poles) and others were executed;
and there were sufficient means for involving some
more Houses of religion, with their heads, notably
the revered Abbot of Glastonbury, who were hanged
as traitors.</p>

<p>Thus, by the opening of 1539, everything was
ready for the two final measures. The regrettable
conduct of the monastic establishments in associating
themselves with treason provided a final justification
for the complete suppression of the system,
and incidentally the further enrichment of the Crown.
In the field of constitutional practice, the Crown
had frequently proceeded by Royal Proclamations,
but there was generally some attendant danger
of the authority of these being challenged. Parliament
was now called upon formally to concede to
such proclamations the effect of regular Statutes.
It may be remarked in passing that the Parliament
called in 1529 had been responsible for the whole
of the legislation down to its last session in the early
spring of 1536, when it passed the Act dissolving
the lesser monasteries. Whether it was subservient
or not, Cromwell had nothing to do with packing
it: it was only at the last moment that he was
provided with a seat in it. But there is no doubt
that the subsequent Parliaments, beginning with
that summoned in May 1536, were packed by Cromwell
and his agents. That was an inevitable part
of the system which was to make the king absolute,
whilst preserving the traditional forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">CROMWELL AND PROTESTANTISM</span></h3>

<p>The policy of organising a Despotism was necessarily
anti-Papal and also anti-clerical. In the
former aspect, it complicated foreign relations;
in the latter, it was involved with the movement
towards a spiritual and dogmatic reformation of
religion. Cromwell’s course in foreign politics was
dictated by anti-Papal considerations. So long as
Katharine, the aunt of Charles V., was alive, there
was no prospect of reconciliation between the
Emperor and Henry, so that England could not
work on Wolsey’s favourite line of holding the
balance between Charles and the French king, who
felt himself perfectly safe from any risk of a renewed
combination between his rivals. Hence, Cromwell
usually hankered for close association with the
German Protestant princes, united in the League
of Schmalkad, as an effective counter to the Emperor.
Such an alliance might either coerce Charles into a
reconciliation with Protestantism and England, or
might make Francis think it worth his while to join
an anti-Papal league. Having this idea in his mind,
Cromwell’s attitude towards Lutheranism abroad
and the religious progressives in England was always
friendly: since he realised that the course of events
must divide Christendom under the Papal and anti-Papal
standards, which came to be called Catholic
and Protestant respectively. If Rome were cast
off by some of her children, while others remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
faithful, sooner or later the latter would be compelled
to unite for the purpose of crushing the
rebels. Thus the defiance of Rome and of Charles
by the pronouncement of the divorce in 1533, was
attended by overtures to the League of Protestant
Princes.</p>

<p>The Lutherans, however, looked askance. They
feared the Greeks <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et dona ferentes</i>; had not Henry
taken the field conspicuously against their leader?
German Lutheranism was deep-rooted in a genuine
religious feeling; it could feel no confidence in the
king of England as a convert to the Augsburg
confession. Therefore the princes and the divines
of Protestant Germany went warily. On the other
hand, the isolation of England made Francis more
than careless of an English alliance unless on terms
extremely profitable to himself. The death of
Katharine, however, in January 1536, changed the
situation. It was no longer necessary for the
emperor to range himself against England. It is
noteworthy that the immediate effect on Cromwell
was to make him desire an Imperial (which meant
the old Burgundian) alliance, but he was promptly
pulled up by the king, who had learnt once before
that Wolsey had been right in his policy of holding
the balance, and that he himself had erred in forcing
an alliance with Charles. The emperor and Francis
fell to fighting again, and for a while England was
approximately in the old position of having each
of the great Powers intriguing for her alliance, while
she held aloof and coquetted with both. Then the
combatants grew tired, and, with the improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
prospect of their reconciliation, their ardour for
English friendship cooled.</p>

<p>Just before this time, Henry’s third wife died.
Neither his first nor his second spouse had provided
him with a male heir; he had divorced the one, and
cut off the head of the other. Jane Seymour did
what was expected of her, but died in the execution
of her duty. One not too sturdy baby boy, and two
daughters who had been judicially pronounced
illegitimate, gave room for uneasiness as to the succession.
A fourth matrimonial venture was thus
rendered advisable: providing opportunities for
diplomatic intrigue. The royal ladies of Europe,
however, do not seem to have coveted the position:
“If I had two heads, one should be at the King of
England’s disposal,” is said to have been the caustic
comment of a suggested bride. Neither Francis
nor Charles would be inveigled. On the contrary,
they patched up a peace in the summer of 1538,
and Henry’s policy of keeping them at odds with
each other, while dangling an English alliance before
both, broke down, as Cromwell’s previous attempt
to join decisively with Charles had been frustrated.
Cromwell fell back on the line which in his heart
he would probably have preferred throughout, of
alliance with the Lutherans: and at last he hoped&mdash;by
finding a Lutheran bride for Henry&mdash;to attach
his master decisively to that policy. Henry gave
a half-hearted assent; the minister made his final
throw. In the moment of seeming victory, his
knell was sounded. Before we come to this, the
last act in Cromwell’s drama, we may revert to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
his relations with the religious movement in
England.</p>

<p>In the whole of his record, so far as we have at
present reviewed it, there is not a scintilla of evidence
to suggest that Henry’s Vicar-General ever cared a
straw about any properly religious question at all.
We can be tolerably sure, no doubt, as to some of
the things he did <i>not</i> believe in. He did not believe
that the Pope was the holder of the keys to heaven.
He did not believe that the clergy were the divinely
appointed channel through whom alone salvation
must be obtained. He did not believe in the effectual
sanctity of relics. Such beliefs would at least
have been impossible to reconcile with his anti-Papal
and anti-clerical campaigns. But it would be
exceedingly difficult to find any positive dogma to
which it would be possible to point as an article of
faith with him. On the other hand, every circumstance
of his life before 1529, known or surmised,
was calculated to produce and to foster scepticism
on the intellectual and carelessness on the emotional
side of religion, generating a hardened materialism.
The resulting attitude towards men who were actuated
by strong religious convictions would be regulated
entirely by policy.</p>

<p>Obviously, then, doctrines which weakened the
hold of the Papacy, the priesthood, and the monks,
on the popular imagination, would recommend themselves
to his mind&mdash;not as particularly credible or
true, but as deserving encouragement, weakening
the spell of the great organisation whose power he
desired, for reasons of policy, to reduce to the uttermost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Hence, it would be his wish to be at least on
friendly terms with the reformers who were defying
the Pope and setting ecclesiastical conventions at
naught. More particularly, he would find the most
dangerous opponents of his political design in that
school of English Churchmen, headed by the Bishop
of Winchester, who were determined to employ every
instrument of intrigue to retain as much power as
possible for the clergy, and he would seek as natural
allies the men like Cranmer who were unqualified
advocates of the Royal Supremacy. Further, he
foresaw the ultimate necessity of a political understanding,
if not the actual alliance which he would
have preferred, with Continental Protestantism.
On the other hand, he was thoroughly aware
that the king plumed himself on his theological
learning and orthodoxy; and it was no part of his
scheme to run counter to the king. Hence, it
became his business so far as he could to influence
Henry in favour of the respectable reformers&mdash;not,
of course, those who were tainted with Anabaptism
or the suspicion thereof. But there is no hint
anywhere in his conduct that he thought of the actual
tenets of any reformers as in themselves worth any
sacrifice. The king took a keen interest in theological
controversies on their merits; his minister
did not.</p>

<p>This view of his attitude, or of what we should
have expected his attitude to be, tallies precisely
with what we know of his actions. When called
upon to intervene in clerical controversies, he habitually
backed up Cranmer as against Gardiner, working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
in concert with him, except when he perceived that
Cranmer wanted to go farther than Henry was
willing to accompany him. Cranmer was a useful
ally, who never lost his place in the royal favour:
and the archbishop’s greatest enemy was his own
also. But when the Six Articles Act was introduced,
and he knew the king’s mind on the subject,
he promptly left his ally in the lurch; though no
doubt his influence was exerted, when it had been
passed, to check its active enforcement. The passing
of the Act&mdash;the crack of the “whip with six strings”&mdash;sufficiently
served Henry’s immediate purpose,
which was to make a display of rigid orthodoxy for
the benefit of the emperor and King Francis. Cromwell,
who had just committed himself to the Lutherans
too deeply to retract, must have viewed the Act
itself with painful feelings; but he could not afford
to resist. Compliance offered the one chance of
bringing his master round.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">CROMWELL’S FALL</span></h3>

<p>The Act of the Six Articles, the Royal Proclamations
Act, and that for the final suppression of the
monasteries, were all passed in the early summer&mdash;May
or June&mdash;of 1539, when Cromwell was already
fully involved in his scheme for creating a matrimonial
bond between Henry and the German
Protestants. In 1538, when peace between Charles
and Francis seemed imminent, he had succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
in persuading Henry to invite a visit from the
Lutherans with a view to arriving at a mutual understanding
on the theological questions: but even the
reconciliation of the French king and the emperor
failed to make the English king at all cordial, and
the envoys went back to Germany in the autumn
with nothing accomplished. As the year drew to a
close, however, there were ominous signs of a league
being formed to threaten England&mdash;which perhaps
was one of Cromwell’s incentives to the destruction
of Exeter and the Poles, by way of a hint to the
Continental Powers that the government was far
too strong to be endangered by any domestic discontents.
The warnings from abroad had their
effect on Henry, who began to think that a counter-alliance
might be really necessary. Thus, immediately
after the New Year, Cromwell opened negotiations
with the intention of obtaining Anne of
Cleves, sister of the young duke, as a bride for King
Henry. Yet even this concession to his policy was
only, so to speak, a half-loaf: since Cleves was not
actually in the League of Schmalkald, or irrevocably
bound to Lutheranism, though the duke happened
to have his own quarrel with the emperor.</p>

<p>In April, another embassy from the League was
in England; but so also was an ambassador from
France, bent on placating Henry&mdash;and about the
same time, intelligence arrived that the emperor
and the League had come to terms. So very cold
water was poured on the Lutheran envoys, to whom
the Six Articles Act was virtually a direct snub:
as it was to Cromwell, whose policy it signified that
Henry meant to desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Yet once more the prospect seemed to right itself
for the minister. It appeared that the king had been
deluded by the diplomatists, and that after all the
chance of a coalition against England was by no
means dissolved. Before the summer was fairly
over, the politest of overtures were passing between
Francis and Charles; while the Duke of Cleves,
who had been to some degree holding off, again
became urgent for the marriage, being, like Henry,
threatened with danger from the restoration of
amity between the two great rivals. Henry was
beguiled into believing that the lady of his minister’s
choice would make him a charming and attractive
spouse; negotiations were pushed forward apace,
and in the last days of December, Anne of Cleves
landed in England. On January 6 the marriage was
celebrated.</p>

<p>But fate was against Cromwell. In the first place,
the king took a violent antipathy to his bride: and
though, for an adequate political end, he would have
accepted the situation, his soul was wroth with the
man who had brought him into it. Moreover, so
far as concerned domestic affairs, the minister had
done all that Henry needed of him. He had so
handled the Church that she lay defenceless under
the king’s hand. He had brought to the block every
one who could be made a figure-head for insurrection,
and had made organised rebellion an impossibility.
He had done all that there was to be done
in the way of despoiling the king’s subjects for the
king’s benefit. Finally, he had just placed in the
king’s hand the last administrative instrument of
despotism in the Royal Proclamations Act, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
had before provided an irresistible weapon in the
Treasons Act. He was not required for any further
religious reforms, since his master had already gone
as far as he meant to travel in that direction. There
was left only one reason why the royal anger should
be restrained&mdash;a demonstration that his foreign
policy was right; that he was needed as foreign
minister. And ere many weeks were passed, conclusive
reasons appeared for judging that the theory
to which Henry had endeavoured to cling was right
after all, that a lasting coalition between Francis and
Charles was a mere bugbear, that there had never
been any need for the Cleves marriage. Moreover,
the demonstration was effected by one of Cromwell’s
two most determined rivals, the Duke of
Norfolk, who at any rate got the credit for bringing
about the open rupture which promptly succeeded
the fraternal embraces of the emperor and the French
king. At last the game was in the hands of Gardiner
and Norfolk. On June 10 the bolt fell. Absolutely
without warning, Cromwell was arrested for treason
at the Council, and sent forthwith to the Tower.
His own weapons were turned against him, his own
interpretation of treason, his own favourite process
of attainder. Like Wolsey, he had served his master
only too well; and his master rewarded him as
pitilessly as he had rewarded the Cardinal. The
only man in England who dared to plead on his
behalf was&mdash;Cranmer. On July 28, Cromwell’s
head was hacked from his shoulders. With what
measure he meted, it had been measured to him
again.</p>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">APPRECIATIONS</span></h3>

<p>Of both More and Cromwell it has been observed
that historians do not greatly vary in their estimates,
when a reasonable allowance is made for Protestant
and anti-Protestant bias. That remark does not
hold good of King Henry. The popular idea of him
is more intimately associated with that of Bluebeard
than of any other hero of fiction or history. Mr.
Froude has created a legend of his own, wherein
the only doubt seems to be whether Henry quite
passed the dividing line between the mere hero and
the demi-god. Most commonly, he appears as a
brutal tyrant. Among the best informed living
authorities in England on the sixteenth century, one
distinguishes him as the most remarkable man who
ever sat on the English throne, and another has
characterised him as a weak-willed bully, always
depending for support on some stronger will than
his own; yet neither the one nor the other shows
signs of having been led to his conclusion by any
marked bias. The data for his reign, in the form of
documents calendared with exceptional skill, are
peculiarly ample; but the opportunities for drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
divergent inferences therefrom are extensive. It
would be too much to call them unique, in a century
which gave birth also to Elizabeth and to Mary
Queen of Scots.</p>

<p><i>From a Portrait by</i> <span class="smcap">Jost van Cleef</span> <i>in the Royal Collection at

<p>About the fourth year of Henry’s reign, Thomas
Wolsey came to the front and remained there for
sixteen years. For another ten years, Thomas
Cromwell was in the king’s service. During this
period of something exceeding a quarter of a century,
did Henry or his ministers control policy? Great
events happened. Did he, in dealing with them,
show himself a great statesman? Or did he merely
play the part of a selfish and greedy libertine? One
can only express a personal opinion. The view
which seems most consonant with the facts may be
broadly stated thus. Like his daughter Elizabeth,
he had a keen eye for character and ability; he could
appreciate statesmanship in a servant, and he knew
how to get the utmost value out of the men he chose
to trust. In the main, he let them carry out their
designs in their own way; but he remained watchful,
and saw to it that if he happened to want anything
not included in their programme, the programme
should be altered. He did not initiate, but he did
adopt and make his own, the principles of Wolsey’s
foreign and Cromwell’s domestic policy. A time
came when he wanted from Wolsey something which
his minister’s genius was not adapted to provide;
and Wolsey vanished. By slow degrees Cromwell
emerged. A time came when Cromwell had given
him all that he could give, and was seeking to draw
his master into paths he did not choose to tread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Cromwell went to the scaffold. In his remaining
years, the king showed no power of striking out for
himself a strong policy for good or for evil; he had
no minister whom he trusted to pilot the ship;
his own pilotage proved crude, and left to the succeeding
government a crop of difficulties with which it
was quite incompetent to cope. His father’s policy
had been his own creation; his ministers had never
been much more than clerks. The eighth Henry
chose ministers to create and carry out a policy for
him, but always under his own control. The peculiarity
of the Tudor genius, which he shared with his
father and his daughter, lay in the unfailing skill
with which they judged men, and their intuitive
appreciation of popular feeling, which kept them
from passing the bounds of acquiescence. Hence,
whatever we may think of their policy itself or of
particular acts, whether our moral judgment condemns
or applauds, whether we account their
measures far-sighted or short-sighted, they stand
out as great rulers, accomplishing what they meant
to accomplish, and displaying their activities on a
great scale.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARDINAL RULES</span></h3>

<p>Henry was his father’s second son. Tradition
says that his sire, ever thoughtful of economy,
destined him for the Archbishopric of Canterbury,
and had him educated accordingly. As the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
however, became, through his elder brother’s death,
heir apparent to the throne at the age of eleven, the
remarkable theological erudition which he displayed
in later years can hardly be attributed to his early
school-room studies&mdash;even if the tradition had any
more basis of fact than that it was at least <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ben
trovato</i>. Whatever career was anticipated for him,
the utmost pains were bestowed on his education,
and he learnt to take a keen interest in intellectual
pursuits. Erasmus gives an agreeable picture of
him at the age of nine, and remarks on the extraordinary
intelligence of his letters a little later&mdash;an
intelligence which made the learned man believe
that the boy’s tutor wrote or revised them, till ocular
demonstration convinced him of the contrary.
Intellectual pursuits, however, did not absorb the
Prince of Wales. His father was not endowed with
any very striking physique, but the boy rather took
after his grandfather Edward IV., being decidedly
handsome, of very athletic frame, and excelling in
the sports of vigorous and healthy youth.</p>

<p>Two months before Henry completed his eighteenth
year, his father’s death placed him on the throne
of England&mdash;successor to a king whose later years
had been conspicuously sordid and gloomy. Spring
with its pulsing, generous life, followed the sapless
dreariness of winter. So men dreamed, and so
probably Henry reckoned, himself. Ugly things
like Empson and Dudley were to vanish into limbo;
the king would celebrate his marriage royally&mdash;and
follow that up by some splendid martial achievement.
It was still permitted to dream mediæval dreams;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
might not the Crescent be once more rolled back
before the advancing Cross? Still, at eighteen there
was no great hurry about that, and meanwhile life
might be very much enjoyed. Kings have servants
about them to take the dull drudgery of politics
off their hands.</p>

<p>A most excellent state of things, in the eyes of the
veterans Ferdinand and Maximilian. The old king’s
martial ardour had resolved itself into occasional
campaigns on which no money was wasted, and in
which no blood was shed, but which somehow had
a trick of resulting in the transfer of hard cash from
somebody’s pocket to that of the English monarch.
But surely this open-hearted boy could be persuaded
that Henry V. set a more attractive precedent than
Henry VII., and that France was a good deal nearer
than Constantinople. To simplify matters he had
beside him a comely and capable wife, devoted to
the Spanish interest, and all the more likely to influence
him, at his age, for being a few years the
elder: and no young prince could have an adviser
half so shrewd as his quite disinterested father-in-law
of Aragon. So the unsophisticated Henry was
carefully manœuvred into war with France. From
which he learned two lessons: one that there was
frequently a very marked difference between the
words of kings and their deeds; the other, that military
glory or political success cannot be achieved without
close attention to detail. Incidentally, the young
king made another discovery; namely that the
comparatively insignificant ecclesiastic whom old
Bishop Fox had introduced into the Council was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
as sharp-witted as Ferdinand himself, could do the
work of ten ordinary men, and always knew what
he was about.</p>

<p>Before the end of 1514, Ferdinand and Maximilian
were made painfully aware that Henry was not
going to be anybody’s tool, by the unexpected
alliance of England and France. The diplomatist
who had beaten them with their own weapons had
won the English king’s entire confidence, and there
was only one possible rival to him, in the person of
Henry’s brother-in-arms, Charles Brandon, newly
created Duke of Suffolk; nor was it long before
it became patent that the brother-in-arms, having
made himself brother-in-law into the bargain by
marrying the princess Mary, might remain the
favourite companion in the hunting field, and the
favourite antagonist in the tournament, but would
have very little to say to the king’s politics. Wolsey
had not only thoroughly impressed his master by
his immense administrative ability, his capacity for
hard work, and his astuteness; he had also succeeded
in giving a new turn to the king’s ambitions, making
them political rather than martial. The campaigns
of 1513 had restored the prestige of English soldiers
at least in a respectable degree; the outwitting of
the craftiest prince in Europe next year showed that
there was a worthy successor to Henry VII.; that
monarch was reputed to have left in the royal coffers
wealth so enormous as to be almost inexhaustible;
Scotland had suffered such a blow at Flodden that
she could not, for the time at least, hamper English
action. Henry therefore could now hold the balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
between the potentates of Europe, and become the
controlling factor in international affairs. Such a
position was much better worth working for than
reconquests of French soil, or even the recovery of
the French crown, which Henry V. had won but had
not lived long enough to wear. As for crusades,
Henry was old enough now to know that in the eyes
of a practical politician they were out of date.</p>

<p>Schemes for dominating Europe were much affected
by the fact that in 1514 many important changes in
the personality of the rulers were obviously impending.
Henry, twenty-three years old, was the only
young man among them. But on the next New
Year’s Day, France was to pass from Louis XII.
to young Francis of Angoulême, aged twenty. In
1516, Ferdinand was to be succeeded by his grandson
Charles, aged sixteen. In 1519, Maximilian was to
disappear; and, inasmuch as the Empire was not
technically hereditary, much would depend on the
Imperial election, in which, however, the chances
were that Ferdinand’s heir would prove to be
Maximilian’s heir also.</p>

<p>From 1514, the figure of Wolsey&mdash;very shortly
to become a Cardinal&mdash;completely dominated English
politics. The king resigned himself wholly to his
guidance, and for many years there was no more
talk of Henry leading victorious armies over the Continent.
The rival ambitions of Francis, Maximilian,
and others, chiefly concerned with the annexation
of Italian States by one potentate or another, the
playing off of rivals, the paying and withholding
of subsidies, were the main business in hand till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
demise of the emperor, early in 1519, opened the
great question, who was to wear the Imperial crown?</p>

<p>Young Charles was already king of all Spain, and
lord of the Burgundian heritage. He was also heir
to the Austrian and other German possessions of
Maximilian, who, like Ferdinand, had been his
grandfather. For some time, Habsburg had followed
Habsburg as emperor. There was no other of the
princes of Germany strong enough territorially to
bear the weight of empire, and Frederic of Saxony,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">capax imperii</i>, had no mind for the undertaking.
If Charles were elected he would wield enormous
powers. The French king, ambitious, and dreading
the further aggrandisement of a rival whose dominions
were already so great, came forward as a candidate:
his success would mean an accession of power to
France even more dangerous to the European
balance than that of Charles. Under these circumstances,
it is not incredible that Henry really meant
business in taking steps with a view to obtaining
the Imperial crown for himself. At twenty-eight,
he was quite young enough to believe that the thing
was really practicable: and if practicable, it would
be a magnificent fulfilment of his ambitions along the
very lines on which Wolsey had directed them. It
is not, however, credible that the Cardinal should
have taken that view; whether the king was or
was not merely playing with the idea, his minister
must have known that it was chimerical. The agent,
Richard Pace, very soon made it quite clear that it
would be sheer waste of energy and money for Henry
to enter seriously for the stakes, and Cuthbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Tunstal was careful to point out that in burdening
himself with the responsibilities of the Empire, he
would be losing for the sake of a shadow the solid
substance of his power as King of England. Henry’s
candidature was withdrawn, and no one was any
the worse.</p>

<p>The episode, however, suggests certain conclusions.
It is almost impossible to doubt that the idea of
the candidature was Henry’s own; it is difficult to
doubt that he did contemplate it seriously. It was
consistent&mdash;in intention&mdash;with the conception of
political predominance as a more substantial object
of ambition than military laurels. It was of a
grandiosity which appealed to the imagination, but
not to the practical judgment of a far-sighted statesman.
That Henry should have taken it up is entirely
consistent with his character as we have conceived
it. On the other hand, if he had been merely a
monarch who allowed himself to be habitually
managed, but broke out in occasional fits of obstinacy&mdash;as
weak men do&mdash;he would have struggled
to the last for that election. In fact, he did interfere
with Wolsey the moment he thought he could better
the minister’s plans, but when he saw he had made
a mistake, but could retire without loss of dignity,
he did so without losing his temper. Later in life
he might have made himself unpleasant to somebody,
under like conditions. That would have depended
very much on how far he had set his heart on the
particular object he found himself called upon to
surrender. In the present case, Wolsey had ostensibly
done everything possible to make the scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
succeed. He may never have attempted dissuasion,
relying on the inherent impracticability of the whole
thing to prevent any really awkward consequences.
At any rate, Henry’s confidence was in no way
diminished.</p>

<p>There was indeed little enough reason to be dissatisfied.
Western Europe was in the hands of
three young men, of whom the eldest, Henry, was
twenty-eight, and the youngest, Charles, was not
twenty. If Charles had the widest dominion, his
task was also the most complicated. He could only
pass to his Teutonic from his Spanish territories by
sea; French territory was continuous. If Charles
and Francis quarrelled, each would want the friendship
of England: for her enmity to Charles would
mean immense injury to the trade of Flanders, and
her enmity to France would mean serious military
embarrassments in the direction of Picardy. So for
some time to come both were eagerly seeking an
English alliance, while Wolsey’s skill was sufficiently
tasked, but not <i>over</i>-tasked, to keep the pair of them
in play; and to keep them at peace, since if they
once went to war it might prove exceedingly difficult
to avoid embroiling England.</p>

<p>In 1520 the competition between emperor and
king for English favour&mdash;which both took to mean
the Cardinal’s favour&mdash;was particularly lively, with
the result that the great meeting at the Field of the
Cloth of Gold took place, designed to signalise the
enthusiastic amity of Henry and Francis. Wolsey,
however, had manœuvred a less magnificent meeting
in England, only just before, between Henry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the emperor; and no one could say that either of
the rivals had really won a lead over the other.
But it became increasingly difficult to prevent a
collision between them, and a year later, when Wolsey
was ostensibly making a great effort at the Conference
of Calais to effect a reconciliation, he was in
reality coming privately to terms with Charles. If
England was to be dragged into a war, she would be
on the Imperial side.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">WAR</span></h3>

<p>Why did England go to war with France, instead
of resolutely holding aloof? The Cardinal cannot
have seriously thought of the war as a means to the
recovery of the French crown: nor can he have
held it good for England that France should be
crippled, and the Emperor magnified. If he went
into the war of his own free will, if he urged it on
Henry, it can only have been with the purely personal
object of so binding Charles to him as to ensure
his own election to the Papacy at the next vacancy.
Yet at the time of the Calais Conference there was
no immediate likelihood of the reigning Pope’s
death; Wolsey was surely the last man to count on
the gratitude of princes for past favours as an
effective motive, and Charles had already shown a
thorough appreciation of the doctrine that promises
are made to be evaded. Moreover, so shrewd a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
as the Cardinal would presumably have felt extremely
doubtful whether the Papacy&mdash;with Charles
master of Europe&mdash;would be much worth having.
The only remaining suggestion is, that Wolsey
foresaw great domestic troubles, and took the time-honoured
course of trying to divert attention by
plunging the country in war. The obvious objection
to that is that there were no pressing signs of disturbance
at all.</p>

<p>The mere fact that the war was a regular reversal
of the methods Wolsey had hitherto followed, points
to its having been undertaken against his judgment.
But is it unreasonable to suppose that it was not
against the king’s judgment? That Henry for the
second time indicated the course which his minister
was to follow, and the minister obeyed rather than
resign? In those days, ministers did not resign,
unless they were exceptional people with consciences,
like Thomas More: and for Wolsey&mdash;whose political
existence, if not his life, depended entirely on the
king’s favour&mdash;to resign would have meant virtual
suicide. On the other hand, there were influences
which would affect Henry in favour of the war,
intelligibly enough. To him, the conquest of France
with the help of Charles may not have seemed absurd,
and he was not ashamed to avow it as his object
to Parliament, when asking for money. Apart from
that, there was always a military party headed by
men who felt themselves much more likely to achieve
honour and fame on the battlefield than in the
Cardinal’s ante-room: and if there was to be war
at all, there was a sort of standing sentiment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
favour of fighting the French. Lastly, the king
was still on good terms with his wife, and his wife
was a most determined advocate of her nephew’s
interests. Henry was even now only just thirty,
and the glamour of military achievement might still
tempt him. It certainly seems the most reasonable
conclusion that it was not Wolsey who dragged the
king into war, but the king who forced war on
Wolsey.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, events proved that there was
very little to be made out of the war. After eight
years, Wolsey found himself compelled to call a
Parliament again, in order to get money&mdash;whereas
it had been his consistent policy to dispense with
Parliament altogether. The war was at any rate
not sufficiently unpopular to prevent the voting
of a substantial subsidy; but as time passed, such
favour as it had found with the public faded; the
Cardinal did not venture, when more money was
needed, to ask Parliament for it again, and when
he tried to raise what was called an Amicable loan,
the response was cold. The disaster of Francis at
Pavia, though it suggested more talk about recovering
the Crown of France, offered no opportunity for
material advantage to Henry, and it very soon
became evident that Charles was so much the master
of Europe that his career would only be held in check
by an Anglo-French alliance, which it became the
Cardinal’s business to contract in 1527.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE “DIVORCE”</span></h3>

<p>This was precisely the time at which there is no
doubt that the question of divorcing Katharine of
Aragon was very much on the minds both of king
and Cardinal. In discussing that subject in the preceding
study of Wolsey, nothing was said of the
theory most adverse to Wolsey&mdash;that the idea
originated with him, and that he suggested it with
the specific intention of breaking the alliance with
Charles and substituting a French marriage, a French
alliance being now his object. On this theory it
is argued that the king’s intention of using the
divorce to marry Anne Boleyn was sprung on the
Cardinal as something quite new, on his return from
the French embassy; his absence having been
turned to account by his enemies, with the simple
object of wrecking his policy and ruining him. The
fact that Henry afterwards publicly acquitted Wolsey
of having instigated the divorce may not count for
much as evidence of his innocence; but there is
another grave objection to the theory. If Henry
told him that the divorce must be managed somehow,
he would doubtless have considered that the
least injurious result would be a French marriage;
but it is not easy to imagine that he would himself
have sought to bring about a step which would have
made so permanent a breach between Henry and
Charles. His own policy was to keep it always in
the power of England to shift from one side to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
other&mdash;to trim the balance between Charles and
Francis. The theory is put forward to square with a
particular view of Henry’s character&mdash;that he was
managed by any one who could get at him. But
it makes the Cardinal himself somewhat unintelligible&mdash;or
unintelligent.</p>

<p>The view advanced in these pages is, that for the
third time the king laid down a policy of his own
for the Cardinal to carry out. In the first place he
had two personal reasons for wanting the divorce&mdash;a
superstitious impression that the failure of Katharine
to supply him with a male heir was Heaven’s
punishment for a marriage which the Pope ought
never to have sanctioned; and a passion for Anne
Boleyn. In the second place, the policy of alliance
with Charles against Francis had worked out badly,
and a rupture with Charles must come in any case.
Wolsey should manage it, or should help: and if
he began with a belief that a French marriage might
be the outcome, there would be no harm done. The
policy, as before, was a deviation from Wolsey’s,
but did not seem superficially to run counter to the
broad principle on which it was based, that England
was to prove her effective predominance by throwing
her weight into the French or the Imperial scale
as circumstances might demand. But, as before,
the method was short-sighted. On the other hand,
we find Wolsey behaving also precisely as he did
before. If the king did elect to lay down a policy,
he must be the instrument through which it should
be carried out. He could not prevent it; he must
make the best of it, and as far as possible neutralise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the bad effects by skilful handling. He made his
attempt, failed, and fell. It would have been better
for his credit if he had fallen in open instead of in
covert opposition.</p>

<p>It remains in any case impossible to dogmatise;
the whole thing is a tangle, and there are difficulties
in the way of accepting each solution. To the theory
that the divorce was primarily a plan of Wolsey’s
in order to facilitate a French alliance, there is a
further objection that a negotiation was already on
foot for marrying the Princess Mary to Henry of
Orleans, the French king’s second son, who afterwards
became Henry II. The substitution of the
marriage of the king himself to a French princess
would have hardly been in itself a closer bond; yet
we should be compelled to believe that Wolsey
deliberately, with no greater advantage in view,
sought to make this change at the cost of a probably
irreparable breach with the emperor. The political
motive is inadequate. Whereas, for the king, who had
a powerful non-political motive thrown in, the plan
becomes intelligible enough. The divorce should
be so managed that Mary’s legitimacy should still
be secured, the marriage with Orleans could go
forward, and he himself would get the wife he
wanted. That in 1527 his passion for Anne was a
very powerful motive is not to be disputed&mdash;the
love-letters, uncertain as their dates are, cannot be
attributed to a still later time.</p>

<p>It is also tolerably clear that the king meant to
have the divorce in any case, whether it upset foreign
relations or not. Moreover, if the plan was Wolsey’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
he would have been satisfied to leave the Cardinal
to work it out, which he was not. From the beginning
he appears to have suspected&mdash;if there was
not more than a suspicion&mdash;that his minister disliked
the whole idea, and would be only too pleased
if it were shelved; and he employed other agents
to get the thing done, behind Wolsey’s back. Wolsey
was very much in the position of a lawyer whose
client, with whom he cannot afford to quarrel, insists
on his adopting a certain course in defiance of his own
judgment. He devised ingenious expedients; he
tried to make his case as safe as possible; he gave
nothing away to the other side; but he was reluctant
throughout, while the king was invincibly obstinate.</p>

<p>Assuming then that it was Henry, not Wolsey, who
from the commencement sought the divorce, the
Cardinal’s consistency is restored. So far also the
consistency of Henry’s character is maintained.
He never laid out a great political scheme, calculating
for the future; but when Wolsey formulated
a large design, he readily recognised its merits, and
recognised Wolsey himself as the man to carry it
through. But three times he was moved with a
desire to obtain a particular end, without realising
that to do so would overturn the main scheme;
on each occasion the minister formally and officially
obeyed his master’s behest. Over the divorce,
however, Henry’s behaviour presents an interesting
psychological study.</p>

<p>There have been many statesmen, successful in
varying degree, who have quite deliberately ignored
moral considerations in their policy. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
not admitted that unrighteous action as such carries
any penalty attached to it. Crime which shocks
public sentiment violently they may avoid; not
because it is criminal, but because public sentiment
cannot be ignored. The mere fact that a particular
course of action involves injustice or cruelty, or
otherwise over-rides the moral law, is not permitted
to weigh at all in judging of its expediency. Such
a one was Thomas Cromwell. There have been
others who would never allow any claim of mere
expediency to countervail against the dictates of
conscience. Such a one was Thomas More.</p>

<p>The average man is content to compromise: not
drawing the line very high, but still drawing it
somewhere. Henry belonged to the class who would
never violate conscience; but, when any particular
course presented itself to his mind as expedient or
desirable, he had a quite unique power of convincing
himself not only that the thing would not be wrong,
but that conscience positively clamoured that it
must be done: nothing was so monstrous that he
could not solemnly persuade himself that it was a
sad duty. There are men who are made that way.
They will rob the widow and swindle the orphan,
but they must and do first trick themselves into an
amazing belief that in so doing they are serving
heaven or society. Henry was much more dangerous
than a commonplace hypocrite who assumes a mask
to deceive the world, since he had to begin by
making the deception convincing to himself.</p>

<p>Thus it was in the matter of the divorce. It was
of real urgent importance that he should have a male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
heir, and there was no hope of his wife giving him
one; he wanted very much to marry Anne, and he
could not do so while his wife was living; but with
what conscience could he get rid of that wife?
Henry’s conscience gave him the answer he wanted,
pat: it always did. Conscience pointed out that
the children of the marriage, except one girl, all
came to grief&mdash;were still-born, or died in a few weeks.
Surely, here was Heaven’s judgment on a sinful
union. True, the contracting parties had sinned
with a Pope’s benediction, and thinking there was
nothing wrong. But clearly the Pope must have
erred. Conscience therefore did not merely excuse,
it demanded, the dissolution of the unholy bond.
Conscience permitted Henry to declare fervently
that nothing would please him so much as to find
that his scruples were groundless; but nothing
would ever have persuaded him that they were so
except perhaps the death of Anne Boleyn. Having
once thoroughly satisfied himself that the divorce
was a duty, whatever any one might say to the
contrary, it followed that some legal method of
accomplishing it must exist. If the Pope did not
see the thing in the same light, there must be something
defective in the Papal authority after all.
The scruple of conscience gradually assumed an
axiomatic character to Henry; and the repudiation
of Clement, who regarded it as an extremely questionable
postulate, followed logically.</p>

<p>Until Clement revoked the cause to Rome&mdash;a
practical demonstration that he would not sanction
a verdict objectionable to the emperor&mdash;nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
demanding revolutionary measures had occurred.
That event, however, changed the situation. There
would have to be a fight with the Papacy, which
could not be conducted under the Cardinal’s captaincy.
The Cardinal had failed badly; his behaviour
had been suspicious. It did not take the
conscientious monarch long to discover that advantage
had been taken of his own generous trustfulness,
that he had been warming a viper in his bosom.
Wolsey was thrown to the wolves. It is curiously
characteristic of Henry that the instrument by which
he shattered Wolsey was the charge of a breach of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Præmunire</i> in accepting and exercising the legatine
authority. The mere fact that this had been done
with the king’s own licence, almost at his instigation,
would have checked any other monarch. Henry
found in it an additional cause of offence. The
Cardinal had not only broken the law&mdash;he, whose
business it was to see that the king did not accidentally
transgress, had actually inveigled the king into
transgression. A just man, tricked by his own
familiar friend into committing an act of injustice,
feels righteous indignation against the friend. Such
was the indignation of the king against the Cardinal,
as of Adam against Eve.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE NEW POLICY</span></h3>

<p>The fall of Wolsey marks, as the beginning of the
divorce proceedings really commences, the second
stage of Henry’s career. Had he died before 1529,
the Bluebeard legend would never have been applied
to him, and his connexion with the Reformation
would have been in effect limited to a controversial
pamphlet in favour of the extreme Papal claims,
directed against Luther. This was all that the uprising
of the great Reformer had evoked from the
prince who was expected to be the royal champion
of the Intellectuals. No one would have called him
a tyrant. It is true that Edmund de la Pole, Earl
of Suffolk, had been put to death at the beginning
of the reign&mdash;as tradition says, in fulfilment of the
advice of Henry VII. It is true also that Buckingham
had been executed, not so much because he
had committed any treason as because he was
thought dangerous; but the world would have been
content to leave that as one of the charges against
Wolsey. Henry would have passed with posterity
as a pleasure-loving monarch with a great taste for
extravagance, who cheerfully left the government
of the country to an able and unscrupulous minister,
and did absolutely nothing personally in the twenty
years of his reign to justify the high hopes with which
his accession was hailed. The reign would have
been recorded as the reign of the Cardinal, and our
ideas of the king himself would have been conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
mainly in the anecdotes of his personal vanity and
love of pageantry and popularity. It is the forcefulness,
energy, and resolution&mdash;or the violence, fickleness,
and obstinacy&mdash;displayed in the second period
which make us revise our judgment of the first, and
set us seeking therein for some appearance of these
same characteristics, and discovering in them the
explanation of some puzzles in the Cardinal’s policy.</p>

<p>The new stage of Henry’s career presents us with
a problem at the outset. Hitherto, he had followed
Wolsey’s counsels; very shortly, the Machiavellian
maxims of Cromwell guided his course; but there is
no one to bridge the gap between Wolsey and Cromwell.
Sir Thomas More succeeded the Cardinal
as Chancellor, but not as first minister&mdash;he never
made any secret, to the king, of his conviction that
the marriage with Katharine could not and should
not be invalidated. Nothing points to Norfolk or
Suffolk as guiding policy. The newly discovered
Cranmer had suggested a principle for dealing with
the divorce, but his appearance is merely in the
character of a University doctor, not of a statesman.
Precisely at this moment, before he knew anything
of Cromwell, with Wolsey, so to speak, hanging on
the very verge of the precipice, a Parliament is
called suddenly, which remains undissolved until
its seventh year. Since 1515 there had been only
one Parliament, that of 1523&ndash;1524. Between 1500
and 1515 Parliaments had been rare. Henry VII.,
when he no longer felt the need of constant Parliamentary
sanction, and Wolsey after him, had gone
steadily on the rule of accustoming the country to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
have the government carried on almost without
Parliaments, and of establishing absolutism on those
lines. From this moment that attitude towards
Parliament disappears. For the rest of the reign,
there is no prolonged interval without one; Parliament
itself is converted into the instrument and the
buttress of despotism.</p>

<p>In the preceding study of Thomas Cromwell the
view was adopted that he was the real author of
what was one comprehensive design for establishing
the royal power high over everything else, including
therein the repudiation of Papal rivalry, and the
subordination of the clerical organisation; while
the method, of deliberately choosing to make Parliament
share the responsibility, was his also. Yet
the calling of this Parliament in 1529, and its initial
measures of ecclesiastical reform, cannot be attributed
to him. Henry did it out of his own head. It will
be found, however, that the apparent contradictions
are easily reconcilable.</p>

<p>Henry found, in 1529, that his determination to
have a divorce would involve either a fight with the
Papacy or a struggle to secure Papal support in
despite of the emperor. Also he felt that the
Cardinal was not to be depended on as the manager
of that struggle. He had no one ready to take the
Cardinal’s place, though Stephen Gardiner might
have done so had he been a layman. He had formulated
no plan of campaign beyond that of sending
the Earl of Wiltshire, Anne Boleyn’s father, with
Cranmer in his train, on an embassy to Bologna.
But he might find himself impelled to do more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
less questionable things; the precedent of his
father’s first years suggested that in that case it
would be useful to be able to say that he had acted
with the sanction of Parliament; and he had the
Tudor instinct of appreciating the value of conciliating
popular sentiment. Nothing would conciliate
popular sentiment so much as inducing his subjects
to believe that it was their interests and their
opinions he was consulting. So he summoned
Parliament.</p>

<p>Thus, Henry called the Parliament: Henry
authorised clerical reform: Henry meditated a
possible quarrel with the Pope. But it was Cromwell
who co-ordinated Henry’s ideas&mdash;clever enough
as far as they went, but not going far&mdash;into a single
far-reaching scheme, wherein the things his master
had thought of were nicely adjusted, gaps were
filled in, consequences calculated, and a systematic
evolution arranged in which every step should seem
the corollary of what had already been accomplished.
How far individual steps were invented by Henry,
and how far by Cromwell, it is not possible to gauge.
Cromwell never assumed the pose of Wolsey&mdash;the
pose which the Cardinal did indubitably adopt,
although it was erroneously inferred from the famous
if legendary phrase, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ego et rex meus</i>. He was always
ostensibly the king’s instrument. In Wolsey’s time
a question had once arisen whether in sending certain
official despatches the full information should be
sent to him, and only general remarks to the king,
or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>. That would not have happened with
Thomas Cromwell. The full official despatch would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
have gone to the king as a matter of course&mdash;but
Cromwell might have had a private unofficial commentary.
Henry, during the Cromwell <i>régime</i>, was
in constant evidence as the ruler of the country.
During Wolsey’s <i>régime</i>, he ostentatiously left the
management in Wolsey’s hands. But during both
periods we can at any rate form a shrewd guess
at the points on which king and minister were in
harmony, and those where the minister had to yield
to the king.</p>

<p>Beyond minor reforms of abuses, and the movement
for taking the opinion of the Universities on
the divorce, there was no immediate sign, after the
Cardinal’s fall, of a definitely anti-clerical or anti-Papal
policy. The first blow&mdash;the demand for a
ransom from the clergy under the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Præmunire</i>&mdash;would
have been entirely characteristic of either the king
or Cromwell: the idea was after all merely a very
much more audacious application of the method
adopted towards Wolsey. Whoever hit upon the
notion, it was made the first step in the systematic
grinding down of the clergy between the upper and
the nether millstones of financial spoliation and
political subjection. The Supplication against the
Ordinaries in Parliament, the Submission of the
Clergy, forced upon Convocation as the clause of the
“Supreme Head” had been, appear to be more
decisively Cromwell’s handiwork. There is no adequate
reason to suppose that Parliament had these
measures thrust down its throat: anti-clericalism
was not a new idea, and was usually popular; and
if the Supplication included matters about which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the general public cared very little, such as the right
of ecclesiastical legislation exercised by Convocation,
it also carefully embodied popular grievances, though
they may not have been as flagrant as was represented.
But on the other hand, if the Supplication emanated
from any one but Cromwell, it implies an elaboration
of organised action among private members which
there is nothing to corroborate. It must have been
what may be called a Government measure, which
on the whole had the support&mdash;possibly the enthusiastic
support&mdash;of the House. The Annates Act,
opposed by the bishops, was not enthusiastically
adopted by the Commons&mdash;not so much because
they objected to depriving the Pope of the impost
as because they saw no reason why the clergy should
be relieved of it. They did not realise that the king
and Cromwell had no intention of allowing it to
become an effective measure of relief at all.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">DIVERGENCES BETWEEN HENRY AND CROMWELL</span></h3>

<p>In short, down to the pronouncement of the divorce,
Henry and Cromwell are clearly working in perfect
accord&mdash;whether minister or king devised the programme:
Convocation is being steadily compelled,
very much against its will, to endorse the propositions
of the Crown, and Parliament is at any rate
acquiescent. We may, however, suspect that Henry,
up to this point at least if not for nearly a year more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
inclined to hope that the Pope might yet give way;
whereas in the overtures to the Lutheran Princes
in 1533 we may see Cromwell working to make
doubly sure the assurance of complete severance from
Rome. The Lutheran alliance was unquestionably a
favourite scheme of Cromwell’s, but the king never
did more than dally with it. In his pet character of
theologian he could never bring himself to accept the
Augsburg Confession, or any compromise which
would have satisfied the Protestants.</p>

<p>Cromwell was always possessed with the belief
that a combination of Powers favourable to the
Papacy would be formed sooner or later for the
destruction of England and the Protestants on the
Continent: the coalition of Charles and Francis
was his bugbear. On the other hand, he saw no
hope of an effective union between England and
France; while he fancied that, if the bar between
Henry and Charles, irremovable while Katharine
lived, were once annulled by her death, the emperor&mdash;whose
troops had sacked Rome in 1527, and who
had in many respects evinced very little real regard
for the Pope’s authority&mdash;might be brought over
to the anti-Papal side. Therefore, whenever he
thought there was a prospect of effecting an Imperial
alliance, he let the idea of the Protestant alliance go;
whenever the Imperial alliance seemed hopeless,
the Protestant alliance re-appeared on his programme.</p>

<p>Henry, however, was not at one with Cromwell.
He looked askance at the idea of a Protestant alliance
because he did not consider himself a Protestant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
on the contrary, he accounted Lutheranism as
heresy, and himself as a pattern of orthodoxy. From
his point of view, the only quarrel with Rome lay
in the Pope’s assertion of usurped claims to jurisdiction,
which either Charles or Francis might find
themselves ready to repudiate in their own dominion
at any convenient moment. He remembered
Wolsey’s doctrine. Francis and Charles had so
many antagonistic interests that they could never
co-operate for long. The business of England was
to make each desire her alliance; to avoid the mistake
of committing herself too deeply to either. For a
short time&mdash;in 1539&mdash;he began to think that Cromwell
might be right about the danger of a coalition,
and accepted the plan of the Cleves marriage as a
defensive measure. The marriage was hardly accomplished
when a fresh breach between the rival princes
showed that his own view of the danger had been
right. There never was, either in his own time or
later, a Catholic coalition against England. At
the same time it is at least a tenable view that a
Protestant union, steadily maintained, might have
had great results; on which it is not uninteresting
to speculate, but the speculation is too much guesswork
to be profitable.</p>

<p>Henry’s views, then, on foreign policy, differed
from his minister’s, and it was Henry’s views that
prevailed, except in the episode of the Cleves
marriage; and in that particular case, there was
so startling an appearance of a real <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rapprochement</i>
between Francis and Charles that the king’s deviation
along Cromwell’s lines can hardly be attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
weakness. And even so he took careful precautions,
as long as the thing was possible, to preserve a
loop-hole for his own withdrawal, however deeply
his minister might be committed.</p>

<p>In the ecclesiastical policy also, as it emerges after
the definite breach with Rome, Cromwell was evidently
more inclined to encourage the advanced
school than his master. Henry made Cranmer
Archbishop, wanting in that post a man who accepted
whole-heartedly the theory of Royal Supremacy.
As long as the reforms proposed were restricted to
dealing with notorious abuses of the kind which
Colet had freely denounced, and to the introduction
of an English Bible&mdash;which the Conservatives might
regard as dangerous, but could not denounce as in
itself heretical&mdash;Henry was prepared to give his
sanction; but whenever doctrines were in question
as to which the followers of the “Old Learning”
were in solid agreement, Henry consistently held with
them. Cromwell, on the other hand&mdash;not from
religious sentiment, but on purely political grounds&mdash;had
Lutheran proclivities, owing to his desire to
conciliate Continental Protestantism. He did not,
as Cranmer did, urge the acceptance of views to
which Henry objected; but his influence was always
in favour of “advanced” appointments, and of a
lax application of the laws which pressed hardly
upon that school. Henry’s personal affection for
Cranmer, a liking for Latimer, and an absence of
any such feeling towards Gardiner and Gardiner’s
colleagues, kept him from active interference in this
respect. But he saw to it that what the law laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
down should be unimpeachably orthodox, and
every attempt of Cromwell’s to draw nearer to the
Lutherans was countered by affirmations of a rigid
adherence to the Old Faith and denunciation of
innovations: culminating in the Act of the Six
Articles. The differences in the formularies of faith
issued from 1536 to 1540 are all in the direction of
increasing definiteness, of leaving fewer questions
open; and the definiteness is always in favour of
the old school. Although the minister officially
supported the Six Articles, while the Archbishop
made all the fight possible against it, the Act was
the king’s deliberate work, and the forcing of it
through was without any possible doubt a direct
set-back for Cromwell. At the same time, however,
Henry took occasion to impress on his Court, with
his usual vigour, that it would be extremely injudicious
for any one to act on the hypothesis that
it involved any diminution of the personal favour
in which Cranmer was held.</p>

<p>In the rest of the domestic policy&mdash;Treason Acts,
Supremacy Acts, Acts of Succession, Dissolution of
Monasteries, Attainders&mdash;there is no opposition
between king and minister. The edifice of absolutism
with the sanction of Parliament is steadily
reared, on the ruins of the ecclesiastical fabric and
of the last families round whom any sort of Yorkist
tradition can centre. When at last it had culminated
in the Royal Proclamations Act, Cromwell
ceased to be necessary; being no longer necessary,
he offended his master; and, offending him, fell as
Wolsey fell before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">HENRY’S CLOSING YEARS</span></h3>

<p>Down to this point, then, from 1513 to 1540, we
may believe that Henry was the puppet first of
Wolsey and then of Cromwell; or that both were
no more than the instruments of his supreme genius;
or that, having with a light heart delegated all his
duties and cares to the Cardinal, he resolved to rule
himself, upset the Cardinal, and used Cromwell as
a tool and scapegoat. Or we may judge that the
creative, designing brains were his ministers’; but
that he deliberately made their policy his own,
except when he had a fancy for diverging from it,
trusting to their pilotage just so long as it suited
him&mdash;that they, not he, were the pilots, but he was
emphatically the captain. We may even believe
that the ministers were responsible only for the
mistakes in execution, the king for the great designs.
But when Cromwell is gone no one takes the vacant
place. Gardiner and Norfolk are at the head of
the Council, which becomes a hotbed of intrigues;
but it is quite impossible to attribute the royal policy
either to any individual or to any clique. Hence,
in the king’s conduct of affairs during the remaining
six and a half years of his life, we ought to find clues
to the nature and extent of the control he really
exercised during the thirty years preceding.</p>

<p>The view here put forward has been, that Wolsey
diverted him from his first merely boyish dreams of
martial achievements, to take hold of the conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of making England stand as the secure arbiter
between the great Powers of the Continent, wooed
by all&mdash;or both, when only two were left&mdash;and able
always to turn the scale if one or other threatened
to preponderate. His brain, however, being somewhat
more liable to inflation than the Cardinal’s,
he compelled the latter, in pursuit of this policy,
to diverge from the right path and commit the
country to the French war&mdash;possibly, though not
on the whole probably, with the notion that the old
grandiose idea of conquering France might become
practicable. Then, just as the blunder was in
course of being remedied, he became obsessed with
the determination to divorce Katharine; a proceeding
which could hardly fail to make friendly relations
with the emperor so impossible as to destroy the basis
of the balancing scheme, which demanded that the
two European rivals should both be anxious to court
English support. Then Cromwell showed him how
to use the divorce as a piece of the machinery by
which the power of the Crown might be made at
least as absolute as any known in European history.
He adopted Cromwell’s plan, but not what Cromwell
regarded as its corollary, the acceptance of the position,
and the alliance of the continental Protestants:
endeavouring to hold himself aloof from alliances,
and, after Katharine’s death, to regain the position
of balance-holder.</p>

<p>Now it has been argued that the policy of 1522
was Wolsey’s own, not the king’s policy forced on
him, because it was only when Wolsey was minister
that a “spirited foreign policy” was acted upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
It is therefore to be noted that when Henry was left
to himself with neither Wolsey nor Cromwell to give
counsel, he did quite evidently take up the almost
defunct Plantagenet notion of imposing the sovereignty
of England on Scotland&mdash;which experience
had shown to be no more feasible than the conquest
of France: and he did again find himself drawn
into an Imperial alliance, and actually at war with
the French. These facts do not amount to a proof,
but they do afford a presumption that the talk about
recovering the French crown had not been altogether
wind, and that the first fighting alliance with
Charles was, like the second, the doing of the king.
Probably Henry’s main motive in going into this
later French war was to compel Francis to withdraw
his support from the Scots. He ought, however,
to have known by this time, first, that France
could not afford to stand by while Scotland was
robbed of the independence which was always a
practical and valuable asset for France when she
was at war with England: and, secondly, that
Charles would play for his own hand, and would find
some excuse for leaving his ally isolated the moment
his own needs were satisfied.</p>

<p>The Scots affair, by the way, supplies another
interesting example of the peculiarities of Henry’s
conscience. The head and front of the party in
Scotland who were most bitterly hostile to England
was Cardinal Beton: who was in close alliance with
Mary of Guise, the queen-mother. Henry was
ingenious enough to discover that Beton was a
rebel, who had secured himself above the reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the law, and that consequently his assassination
would be rather commendable. It is not surprising
that the Cardinal was murdered in due course, and
that the murderers looked to England for support.</p>

<p>The history of these later years, in short, lends
colour to the view that the political errors&mdash;in
foreign affairs&mdash;committed in Wolsey’s days were
forced on him by the king: and also that the king
himself did not formulate large political conceptions
on his own account. More than that, it shows him
capable of such serious blunders as the proposal to
re-assert the old fable of English suzerainty in Scotland,
and&mdash;what was in its own way hardly less
short-sighted&mdash;the wholesale debasement of the
coinage. It was not till he was left to manage things
with no strong counsellor to aid him that he gave
way completely to this most evil propensity of his
last years. The thing did incalculable mischief,
ruining credit, driving up prices, robbing creditors
for the benefit of debtors, and, of course, driving all
the sound coins out of circulation. It is to the credit
of Somerset in the next reign that, in spite of the
depleted treasury, he did not carry that disastrous
experiment further: it was left for Northumberland
to degrade the currency even more than Henry had
done. And it was Henry who had done it, not
Wolsey or Cromwell or Gardiner. These things
would seem to mean that, left to himself, it was his
tendency to resort to paltry and short-sighted tricks
and devices of a kind incompatible with the higher
statesmanship; tricks which seem at the moment
to effect their purpose, but are a mere evasion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
difficulties with which they pretend to deal. In
these years, Henry’s statesmanship makes a poor display.
We may plead on his behalf that physical
disease weakened his intellectual powers, that
practically unchecked despotism produced moral
degeneration, that we cannot judge the qualities of
a man whose rule had been&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;undeniably
powerful for a quarter of a century, by
the mismanagement of the years when he was
wearing into his grave. There is truth in the plea.
Yet from the degeneration we can infer the inherent
defects. The man who muddled his Scottish policy,
and left the arrangements for carrying on the government
at his death in a state of chaos, was not he
who planned, organised, and carried out the defiance
of the Papal power and the subjection of the Church;
but he may have been perfectly capable of appreciating
that vast scheme, and of playing a formidable
part in the execution of it. On the other
hand, had he been merely a vain tyrannical bully,
there was more than one man in his <i>entourage</i>
after Cromwell’s fall, who would have had the wit
to make a puppet of him&mdash;which no one certainly
succeeded in doing.</p>

<h3>VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">HENRY’S MARRIAGES</span></h3>

<p>A study of Henry’s character, however brief,
would be incomplete if it omitted to touch on his
widely varied marital relations. The Blue Beard
legend may by this time be fairly looked upon as
exploded. He did not marry one wife after another
to gratify capricious passions, and, when he was weary
of the new toy, cut her head off and get himself
another. Except in the case of Anne Boleyn, and
possibly Jane Seymour, passion can have had very
little to say to his various ventures. His Court was
licentious; but the king himself does not appear to
have been worse than his neighbours, even if he was
no better. Political intriguers tried to obtain influence
through mistresses; there was certainly an
attempt to supplant Anne Boleyn by this means,
and the Earl of Surrey&mdash;who was probably innocent
enough of real treason but otherwise deserves very
little of the pity that has been wasted on him&mdash;tried
to persuade his own sister to establish herself at the
king’s ear in the same way. There is hardly a shadow
of doubt that Anne Boleyn’s elder sister Mary was
Henry’s mistress before he turned his eyes upon
Anne. Rumour declared, though the statement is
not substantiated, that Sir John Perrot, who did
good work in Ireland in Elizabeth’s day, was really
Henry’s son. It is probable, however, that there
were no children of his born out of wedlock except
the son of Elizabeth Blount, whom he made Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of Richmond and was credited with intending to get
legitimised, when there was no likelihood of a
legitimate male heir appearing. The state of the
Court was such that Chapuys declined to believe
in the otherwise unimpeached virtue of Jane Seymour,
merely on the general principle that no woman
could be supposed virtuous under the conditions
there prevalent&mdash;but Chapuys was writing at a
moment when he was feeling particularly hot against
the whole Court. An item in the royal accounts has
been supposed to indicate that Henry kept a sort of
harem, but that is based on what is almost certainly
a misinterpretation of the term “mistress.” Henry
was licentious enough, but there is no reason to
imagine him as a satyr, or as on the same plane
with Francis I. The kings of the sixteenth century,
bad or good, were not often clean livers. The way
to Henry’s favour was never through the good graces
of the favourite of the hour; and except in the case
of Anne Boleyn it never appears that he allowed any
passion to interfere with his politics.</p>

<p>At eighteen, as soon as he ascended the throne,
Henry married the wife secured for him by the diplomacy
of Henry VII. and Ferdinand and the complaisance
of the Pope. Katharine was four years
the elder, sufficiently good-looking, capable, and
fit to be a queen. She had already been the bride
of the young king’s elder brother, who had died
very shortly after the nuptials: but the Pope had
duly provided a dispensation to permit the second
marriage. She and her husband got on satisfactorily
enough for a time. In 1513, when he was displaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
his martial prowess in Picardy, she was occupied in
organising the Flodden campaign and wrote to him
in a tone implying that they were excellent friends:
yet it is possible to recognise a certain want of tact,
in the absence of that adroit flattery which Henry’s
vain soul loved, when she dwells on her own achievements
instead of praising those of her lord. Henry
soon grew cool&mdash;there is no reason to suppose that
he was ever her ardent lover&mdash;and already, when
babies died or were still-born, he seems to have
turned his mind to a divorce, though he dropped the
idea again. When the princess Mary was born
and did <i>not</i> die, the big jovial monarch made a great
pet of the child; and though he was unfaithful to
his wife, and had no compunction about it, the conventional
friendliness was maintained. There is no
doubt that the queen exercised active influence to
secure England’s favour for her nephew Charles V.;
and critics have found, in the desire of Henry and
Wolsey, a few years later, to break with Charles and
form an alliance with France, one of the leading
motives which recommended the divorce to them.</p>

<p>About 1522, Anne Boleyn came to Court; and
from this time, favours began to flow in the direction
of the Boleyn family. The probabilities are,
however, that as yet they were due rather to the
complaisance of the elder sister Mary than to the
attractions of the younger. Four years later, it is
clear that Anne had become the object of the king’s
pursuit; but, whether because she was more virtuous
or more ambitious than Mary, Anne would not
surrender herself. The king became the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of an absorbing passion, which made him determined
to procure the divorce from Katharine at any
cost&mdash;whether or no it was primarily responsible for
reviving the idea. Once embarked on it, Henry
was far too obstinate to allow anything to divert
him. Towards the end of 1532&mdash;as soon as Warham
was dead&mdash;he saw his way. Before the year was
out, Anne had become his mistress or his wife; a
marriage ceremony was performed in January&mdash;possibly
in November. It is not easy to believe&mdash;though
the evidence points that way&mdash;that Anne,
after holding out till the prize was actually in reach,
would have risked everything by yielding without
insisting on the ceremony first taking place.</p>

<p>The marriage was extremely unpopular; the new
queen was spiteful, flighty, undignified, if nothing
worse. In a very short time, Cranmer was the
only friend she had left; she lost her charm for her
husband, and she annoyed him by the same failure
to fulfil his expectations as Katharine. The old
idea cropped up again, that on this as on the previous
union the blessing of heaven did not rest. The
king found himself attracted by the somewhat
inconspicuous charms and persistent virtue of Jane
Seymour. Charges were brought against Anne,
which may or may not have been true; admissions
were made to Cranmer, the nature of which we can
only guess at; on the strength of the former, she
was condemned to death for treason, and on the
strength of the latter the marriage was declared void
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab initio</i>. The unhappy woman was beheaded;
next day, according to Chapuys, the king married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Jane Seymour privately. The official marriage
was ten days later.</p>

<p>Jane appears to have been a pleasing, colourless,
irreproachable person; who, when she had given
birth to the much-desired son, departed to another
world without having suffered any estrangement
from her husband. He, however, was wife-hunting
again before long&mdash;not because he was attracted by
any one, but for purely political ends. Unfortunately
he was not satisfied by the possession of purely
political qualifications on the part of the ladies, but
offended their susceptibilities by wishing to inspect
them. At last Cromwell beguiled him into approving
the Cleves marriage; but when Anne came over, and
retreat seemed impossible, he first found that she
was not at all to his taste, and then that the political
reasons for wedding her had been quite inadequate.
So the ecclesiastical lawyers set to work again to
discover an excuse for annulling that marriage;
and in the meantime the Duke of Norfolk produced
a young niece of his own, Katharine Howard, who
took the king’s more than middle-aged fancy. Being
quit of Anne, he married the girl, who successfully
cajoled him for about a year: after which, the
faction opposed to Norfolk discovered and laid before
the unfortunate husband evidence of undoubted
immorality before and probable immorality after
her marriage. So Katharine Howard followed Anne
Boleyn to the block. The affair seems to have been a
really complete and very painful surprise to Henry.</p>

<p>By this time, the jibe attributed to the Duchess of
Milan when Henry was thinking of marrying her&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>“Had
I two heads, one should be at his majesty’s
disposal”&mdash;would have been quite excusable. Even
the ladies of his own Court were not covetous of the
queenly throne. Chapuys, ever cynical, hinted that
an Act passed at this time would quite account for
reluctance on their part: if the king should propose
to marry a subject, she must confess any improprieties
of which she had been guilty; otherwise, if they
were subsequently discovered, she would be held
guilty of treason. Still Henry discovered one more
lady who was willing to take the risks&mdash;a lady of
much conjugal experience, now a widow for the
second time. This was Katharine Parr, whose
last husband had been Lord Latimer. Her virtue,
however, was as much above suspicion as Jane
Seymour’s had been; she was sensible, careful, and
extremely tactful; and when an attempt was
made to set her husband against her as a
heretic, she satisfied him very easily, and her
accuser had to submit to one of Henry’s ratings.
She survived him, and married Admiral Thomas
Seymour.</p>

<p>The marriages with Katharine of Aragon and
Anne of Cleves were both avowedly and professedly
political. That with Anne Boleyn was one of passion;
that with Katharine Parr one of inclination. It is
extremely doubtful whether either was effectively
promoted by political intrigue. It is hardly at all
doubtful that in the two remaining cases it was
political intrigue which brought both Jane Seymour
and Katharine Howard under the king’s notice;
nevertheless, it is not likely that either of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
marriages affected the king’s policy, though the
disastrous termination of the second did so.</p>

<h3>IX<br />

<span class="subhead">HENRY’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p>The end of Henry’s life was quite characteristic.
For some time beforehand every one knew that he
could not last long; and intrigues were rife to secure
power when he was gone. The Earl of Hertford,
Jane Seymour’s brother, was at the head of that
one of the two main factions whose leading ecclesiastic
was Cranmer; they were balanced by Gardiner,
with the old Duke of Norfolk and his son Henry Earl
of Surrey. A false move on Surrey’s part gave a
handle to the enemy; Surrey was executed; Norfolk
was attainted and his life saved only by Henry’s
own death; Gardiner’s name was excluded from the
council of “executors,” which is supposed to have
been intended by the king to balance the two parties.
Henry, left to himself, did not display wisdom in his
government, but he always at the worst held the
reins in a fast grip and sat firm in the saddle. His
arrangements for carrying on the government after
him were short-sighted, and his successor in the
saddle, Hertford, was as much his inferior in practical
mastery as he was superior in his ethical aims.
The results are discussed in another chapter. Henry
was almost <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in articulo mortis</i> before any one ventured
to tell him that his hours were numbered. At last he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
allowed Cranmer to be summoned. When he arrived,
the king was speechless; but being besought to give
some sign that he put his trust in Christ, wrung the
Archbishop’s hand. An hour afterwards, he was
dead.</p>

<p>Henry’s career leaves a pretty wide option for
forming a judgment of his character. After making
every possible allowance for flattery, we know that
he was exceptionally accomplished, cultured, athletic;
he could hold his own with any one, in an
argument or in the tilt-yard. His physical courage
has been impugned, principally because in respect
of infectious diseases he was notoriously a coward.
As a young man, if he was unfaithful to his wife he
at any rate observed the expected courtesies; it is
not surprising to find that as the divorce proceedings
went on his manner deteriorated, till his treatment
of Katharine, of his daughter Mary, of Anne Boleyn
when she lost her hold on him, can only be described
as blackguardly. No one, perhaps, would venture to
ascribe to him a fervent zeal for religion; but he
was intensely satisfied with the rigidity of his own
orthodoxy. It is one of the many ironies of his
career that his religiousness has been praised exclusively
by people whom he would have sent to the
stake as heretics without a moment’s hesitation. If
he let Cranmer have his way about an English Bible,
it was not from an enthusiastic admiration of the
Scriptures, but because he knew that some of the
clergy thought it would weaken their influence.
The nature of his own creed is conveyed in the Act
of the Six Articles. Of his “morality,” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
restricted sense of that term, enough has already been
said; it was that of his age and his rank. For his
conception of honour, his applications of the Statute
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Præmunire</i>, and the return he rendered to Wolsey
and Cromwell and More for their services, are sufficient
witness. In the case of More, by the way,
it was characteristic of him that when the report of
the ex-Chancellor’s execution was brought to him,
he turned on Anne Boleyn and told her it was all
her doing. For a high-minded man, his approval
of the schemes for getting James Beton kidnapped
when under a safe-conduct, and for the murder of
David Beton, seems a little peculiar; yet in those
times, it cannot be denied that similar schemes
found sanction in most unexpected quarters. As
far as politics were concerned, he kept his promises,
on the whole, a shade more loyally than Charles
and Francis and their successors. Ferdinand and
Maximilian, of course, had never begun to think that
promises could be looked upon as binding.</p>

<p>As a statesman: we must reject the theory that
he was merely a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Roi Fainéant</i> who liked to fancy that
he was running the machine while he was merely
dancing to the tune called by cleverer men than
himself: we reject also the theory that the policy
followed throughout was his own creation, and that
Wolsey and Cromwell stood in the same relation to
him as Morton and Fox to his father. He was not a
far-seeing man himself, but he knew a far-seeing man
when he found one, having an unfailing instinct for
judging other men’s capacities and limitations,
intellectual and moral. He was ready to recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
their insight and foresight, their organising and
administrative powers, to lay the burden&mdash;and the
reproach&mdash;on their shoulders; but if they did not
convince his judgment, they had to obey his behests,
not he theirs. And yet there is one field wherein
credit, and very high credit, attaches to Henry&mdash;credit,
moreover, which appears to be entirely his
own. As Wolsey had his hobby, education, so
Henry had his hobby, the navy. A Royal Navy, a
fleet whose business was fighting, was practically his
creation. It may very well be that he was much
wiser than he knew himself in this matter&mdash;that
his ships were to him something of a toy. But what
he did went far to making the glories of his daughter’s
reign possible, as the army of Frederick I. of Prussia
made the army of Frederick II. possible.</p>

<p>Finally; although we have denied him personally
the greatest qualities of statesmanship displayed by
his ministers, he did possess in a very high degree
certain essential qualities of a successful ruler. No
mere blustering tyrant would have held England in
his grip for thirty-seven years; the annals of princes
of that type may be terrible, but they are brief.
The masses may be held in subjection by a powerful
upper class for an indefinite period; the continued
power of an individual tyrant&mdash;of an active and
resolutely aggressive autocratic ruler&mdash;depends on
his preserving the loyalty of the active part of his
subjects. That loyalty Henry retained; he never
had the smallest difficulty in stamping out every
attempt at resistance. Mere ruthlessness will not
account for it; ruthlessness by itself rouses new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
enemies: a reign of sheer terror is brief. To the
instinct for gauging men he added the instinct of
gauging popular sentiment&mdash;a perception of the line
which must not be over-stepped; a knack of gracious
and timely withdrawal if ever he seemed to have
passed the danger-point. Withal, he recognised that
the surest method of getting his own way was to make
his subjects believe that it was their way too. His
figure is very, very far from being god-like; it is
quite remote from the heroic; it might, however,
have fairly been called Titanic, if that term did not
imply ultimate failure&mdash;for he did not fail. Neither
his intellectual nor his moral qualities permit us
to love him, to praise him, or to honour him; and
yet, if we have read him aright, it is impossible not
to admire.</p>

<h2 id="PROTECTOR_SOMERSET">PROTECTOR SOMERSET</h2>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">MISCONCEPTIONS</span></h3>

<p>Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was Protector
and the most prominent personality in English
politics for a period only just exceeding two years
and a half. As Earl of Hertford, he grasped the
reins of power when Henry VIII. died; but since the
fall of Thomas Cromwell, Henry had reigned without
allowing any of his servants to occupy a pre-eminent
position, and the Earl of Hertford had certainly
not been an exception. After his overthrow in the
autumn of 1549, his political influence was never
strong enough to affect the measures of his successor:
it sufficed merely to bring about his own execution
as a preventive measure. The whole reign of Edward
VI. is, in fact, quite sharply divided into the two
periods of the Seymour ascendency and the Dudley
ascendency; but the distinction somehow seems
to be very commonly overlooked, and Somerset is not
only credited with his own doings or misdoings, but
with a goodly share of those for which Northumberland
was responsible, and with which Somerset was
entirely out of sympathy.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that it would be difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
to find two men whose ideas were more thoroughly
antagonistic than those of Somerset and Northumberland:
a view not very easily reconcilable with the
popular verdict, which seems to regard Somerset as
being a weaker if rather more amiable edition of
his rival. It is certainly well that the latest detailed
study of the Protector’s career should have at least
sufficed to make the old method of treating him
inexcusable for the future. Without accepting all
Mr. Pollard’s inferences as to his subject’s abilities
and character, it must be recognised that the portrait
presented in his <i>England under Protector
Somerset</i>, if somewhat “flattered,” will have to be
seriously reckoned with by all future historians of the
period.</p>

<div id="ip_206" class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;"><img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p><i>PROTECTOR SOMERSET</i></p>

<p><i>From a Painting by</i> <span class="smcap">Holbein</span></p></div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, it may be doubted whether the
impression left by that volume is quite what the
author intended to convey. The suggestion certainly
is that the Protector was really a great man who
only failed because he was too much in advance of
his age. But in fact, while he possessed certain
qualities essential to the great statesman though by
no means requisite for a successful politician, he
lacked others which are necessary to either character.
Some of the projects for which he laboured most
strenuously were wrecked, not because they were
out of reach, but because of his own inherent incapacity
for adapting means to ends; and the general
effect of his efforts was not to bring the objects he
had in view within nearer reach, but to make them
more difficult of attainment than they were before.
Failure is no condemnation. Wiclif failed, and Huss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
failed; but they made the Reformation possible.
Somerset failed, and there was hardly one of his
aims which had been advanced a single step by his
action. A statesman, to deserve the title in its full
sense, must be an idealist in his aims, but practical
in his methods. The unpractical statesman may
deserve our sympathy and our admiration; but
we may not therefore give him the full meed of
applause which belongs to the benefactors of the
race or nation. The unpractical idealist may be
invaluable when he is a voice only. When the control
of public affairs falls into his hands, he is a public
danger.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PROTECTOR AND HIS PROBLEMS</span></h3>

<p>Edward Seymour was born about 1505: of good
family, but not of high rank, though there was a
strain of Plantagenet blood on the mother’s side. At
any rate, the Seymours were connected with the
Court, and the future Protector was still a boy when
he was holding offices associated with Royalties.
When Henry VIII. tired of Anne Boleyn, Jane
Seymour was the new spouse on whom his choice
fell. The marriage naturally brought advancement
to her brother; and though she did not long survive
the birth of her son, Seymour, who had by this time
been appointed to the Privy Council and raised to the
earldom of Hertford, continued to enjoy favours as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
man of undoubted talents and attractive personality&mdash;and
uncle of the heir apparent. Favours, however,
meant very little in the way of power. He discharged
various functions and took part in sundry military
operations in France and Scotland; but apart from
one smart action near Boulogne, very little real credit
attaches to his performances, which consisted for the
most part in sacking the city of Edinburgh, and
laying waste the Scottish border with rather more
than usual in the way of burning and devastation.</p>

<p>Such as they were, however, these achievements
sufficed to bring him some prestige as a commander.
If there was nothing particularly brilliant about
them, the same comment applies generally to those
of his fellows and rivals. There was no one marked
out by his talents to take up the reins of government
when the king should die and be succeeded by
a nine-year-old son. But it was fairly obvious that
either the Howards, or Hertford in virtue of his
relationship to the young Edward, must occupy the
leading position. Intrigues and the folly of Surrey
turned the scale against the Howards; Surrey
and his father were both attainted; the former was
executed and the latter escaped only through
Henry’s death. Hertford was inevitably the man of
the hour.</p>

<p>There was no manner of doubt about the succession.
Henry left only one son, and that son’s legitimacy
was unchallenged. But by a wholly unique
measure, Henry had been empowered to fix by will
not only the course of succession after his son but the
method of carrying on the government during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Edward’s minority. The will, when produced, was
found to vest the control in a council of executors,
giving priority to none, but remarkable as excluding
Bishop Gardiner from the list. The genuineness
of the document has been disputed, but probably
without sufficient reason. At any rate, as it stood,
its provisions were very far from satisfying Hertford’s
ambitions, and it is hard to see how any one could
have had a personal interest in giving it such a shape.
Certainly he had none, and his immediate efforts were
directed to inducing the new Council to alter its
own constitution fundamentally. For two days
the king’s death was kept secret, while Hertford
laid his plans in conjunction with Paget, who
had possession of the will. When the Council was
summoned and the will produced, a proposal was
immediately sanctioned appointing Hertford Lord
Protector of the realm and of the king’s person.
The assent of the king and the peers was formally
obtained, and a few weeks later the appointment was
confirmed by the king’s authority under the Great
Seal. In the interval there had been a general distribution
of honours, Hertford himself being made
Duke of Somerset. Also the one member of the
Council from whom serious opposition was to be
feared, Wriothesley the Lord Chancellor (now made
Earl of Southampton), justified his own removal by
transgressing his powers. Somerset’s position was
thus for the time at least made impregnable.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. himself and his second great minister
Cromwell had conducted the government of the
country on autocratic lines under colour of parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
forms, until Parliament itself assigned, not
to the Crown as such, but to Henry personally, what
amounted to the power of legislation by Royal Proclamation.
Somerset, though without this statutory
power, continued to make a free use of proclamations,
such being in effect the system to
which the country had become accustomed. He did
not appreciate the change which had taken place.
For the successful exercise of those powers a
personality was needed which commanded unquestioning
obedience, coupled with an unerring sense
of the limits of endurance in the subjects. In
neither respect was the Protector endowed with the
necessary qualities.</p>

<p>There were problems enough to be dealt with to
have daunted a master of statecraft. Over the
Channel, there was France, aggrieved because England
was just now holding Boulogne in pawn. The
veteran Francis I. followed his English contemporary
and rival to the grave in a very few weeks, and the
son who succeeded him was by no means friendly to
England. Across the northern border there was
Scotland, with a baby queen, a queen-mother who
was one of the Guise family who were in the ascendant
in France, and a dominant party which in its national
sympathies was French, and, in the religious point
of view, regarded Henry as a schismatic and all
advocates of the Reformation as heretics. At home,
it was quite certain that the removal of Henry’s
heavy hand would be followed by a renewal of the
strife in the Church between the followers of the
“Old Learning,” headed by Gardiner, Bonner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Tunstal, and those of the New, whose chief was Archbishop
Cranmer. In addition, there was a grave
social problem.</p>

<p>For a full half century a steady process had been
at work throughout rural England of extending
sheep-farming at the expense of cultivation. It was
a process which paid the land-owners, owing to the
large demands from abroad for English wool. But
it was not equally satisfactory to the agricultural
labourer, who was deprived of his customary employment
(since sheep-farming required far fewer hands)
and found no adequate compensation as yet in the
industrial growth of towns. The evil was aggravated
by the iniquitous manner in which landholders
systematically seized every opportunity of appropriating
common lands. In the main, this was the
outcome of natural economic tendencies, which
repeated attempts at legislative interference entirely
failed to hold in check. But these troubles had been
directly intensified by the action of Henry’s government
for more than ten years past. The dissolution
of the monasteries had deprived the peasantry of
an easy-going and on the whole kindly group of landlords,
and replaced these by another group who were
generally greedy and rapacious. Moreover, the
wholesale and monstrous debasement of the coinage,
an expedient to which Henry had been driven by
the depletion of the exchequer caused by his extravagance,
had brought about a corresponding drop
in effective wages, besides shaking financial stability
and commercial confidence, with the unfailing
disastrous results. From all of which, wide-spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
misery and want were prevalent, more particularly
in the rural districts.</p>

<p>These problems, we have said, might well have
daunted even a master of statecraft. But for each
of them the sanguine duke had his solution. It was
with no mere paltry self-seeking designs that he had
grasped at power. He had elected himself to the
office of saviour of society: to the great disgust of
some of those members of the Council who had
connived at his elevation, in the confident belief
that his interests and their own were identical, and
would be the first objects at which his government
would aim.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">SOMERSET AND SCOTLAND</span></h3>

<p>At the outset, it was to Scotland that the Protector
gave his attention.</p>

<p>Two hundred years before the first Tudor ascended
the throne of England, one of the ablest rulers this
country has known realised that the union of England
and Scotland as a single nation was an eminently
desirable object. He sought to achieve that object
by force of arms. He conquered Scotland, and
Scotland rebelled. Every time he reconquered her,
she rebelled again. His last attempt at invasion
was foiled by his own death, and during the reign
of his incompetent son, Scotland finally and decisively
threw off the yoke he had attempted to impose.
Every subsequent attempt to reimpose that yoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
was foiled. Scottish barons might and did take pay
from English kings, but in general terms it is safe to
say that the expectation of an attempt at the armed
conquest of the northern country was the one thing
which could effectively, if only temporarily, induce
the factions of the Scottish nobility to lay aside their
personal and family feuds, and unite in resistance
to the Southron. Another method of reconciliation
had attracted the astute Henry VII., who married
his eldest daughter to the Scots king&mdash;not indeed with
the definite expectation that a union of the two
crowns would result, but still with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrière pensée</i>
that such a result was not impossible. From the
fatal day of Flodden till the death of Henry VIII.,
Scotland had been alternately the prey of rival
factions, and the English king had found that the
simplest way of keeping his northern neighbours
from becoming dangerous was to foster those rivalries.
He had gone out of his way to prevent his elder
sister’s offspring from inheriting the English throne,
by postponing their claims in his will to those of her
younger sister’s descendants. But he had on the
one hand been favourably disposed to the idea that
his own boy should marry the infant queen of Scots
when the two were old enough; and he had more
than once implicitly, if not quite explicitly, asserted
the old claim of English suzerainty, with a view
to the ultimate subjection of the Scottish to the
English crown if it should prove convenient to try
enforcing it.</p>

<p>Now at the moment of Henry’s death there was a
party in Scotland which depended for its chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
success very largely on English aid. This was the
Protestant section, which had just recently accomplished
the murder of Cardinal Beton. The Catholics
looked to France and the queen-mother’s Guise
kinsfolk for support. Various important persons
were as usual quite ready to take either side, as
opportunity might render convenient. But the
assassins of the Cardinal were still in possession of
the Castle of St. Andrews. It seemed clear that if
England gave active support to this section and
prevented the arrival of reinforcements to the other
party from France, English influence would predominate.
If St. Andrews fell, the French party
would acquire complete ascendency.</p>

<p>Somerset had no lack of political imagination.
The idea of the union with Scotland appealed to him
very strongly indeed. A less enthusiastic advocate
of that policy might very well have been content to
let things drift, reckoning that at worst Scotland
would be no more willing to submit to a French than
to an English domination, and that the moment of the
almost inevitable anti-French reaction would be the
time for a <i>rapprochement</i>. Scotland might after
all be postponed to matters that were more immediately
pressing. But there was an obvious alternative&mdash;to
espouse the cause of the Protestant leaders
in Scotland, confirm them as a heartily Anglophil
party thoroughly committed at least to the English
alliance, and establish them in a secure ascendency.</p>

<p>Neither of these courses, however, would achieve
the solution on which the Protector was bent&mdash;the
union of the two countries under a single Crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
It was true that there were plenty of Scots who in
the abstract regarded such a union as desirable, and
had expressed approval of the particular means
proposed to that end&mdash;the marriage of Edward and
Mary. If the sexes of the children had been reversed,
the scheme might have run smoothly enough.
But the Scottish idea of a union meant a union on
equal terms, and anything which pointed to a danger
of the smaller country being subordinated to the
larger was apt to kindle a fierce flame of opposition.
It would require a great deal of diplomatic tact to
convince the Scottish nation at large that the contemplated
marriage would not be turned to account
so as to subordinate Scotland. If England now
took up the cause of the Protestants, it was more
than probable that when they were in power they
would find sufficient reasons for evading the marriage.
The Scots lords who had expressed approval were
already making it clear that they did not intend to
be bound by their past declarations.</p>

<p>Somerset desired the union by assent. But if the
Scots would not assent, he meant to enforce it.
The object in view was excellent, the method was
ruinous. He saw nothing for it but invasion. The
castle of St. Andrews fell, and the party friendly to
England lost ground. Somerset dropped hints about
the old claim of suzerainty, and Scottish indignation
grew. His own previous record in Scotland did not
encourage confidence in his good intentions. Early
in September, Somerset crossed the border at the
head of a large army. It availed nothing that the
Scots army was completely shattered at Pinkie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Cleugh&mdash;a defeat due to the same blunder which
had given Surrey the victory at Flodden and was to
give Cromwell the victory at Dunbar, as well as to
the superiority in artillery of the smaller English
army&mdash;and that Edinburgh was again sacked.
Somerset’s plans had not extended to preparing an
army of occupation. The principal effect of the
invasion, in strict accordance with unvarying precedent,
was to set the whole of Scotland in fierce
opposition to the union, with the result that shortly
afterwards little Queen Mary was embarked on French
ships and carried off to France, to be placed under
the care of her Guise uncles and betrothed to the
French Dauphin, while the Guise ascendency in
Scotland was confirmed.</p>

<p>Had the Protector been actuated mainly by a
desire to achieve popularity, the Pinkie campaign
would have been a brilliant success. But his aims
were far higher. His conception of a union with
Scotland was so far in advance of his times that it
was not even realised by the union of the crowns in
1603, or until the Treaty of Union in 1707, more than
150 years later. That in itself is sufficient to demonstrate
that his statesmanship had its quite admirable
side. On the other hand, the means by which he
endeavoured to secure those aims were absolutely
the worst that could have been devised. The
Pinkie campaign placed them more completely and
hopelessly out of reach than any inaction or any
other measures he could possibly have contrived.
That is sufficient to explain why his government was
on the whole so disastrous. He had thrown Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
into the arms of France, and made France
herself more instead of less hostile to England.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">SOMERSET’S RELIGIOUS POLICY</span></h3>

<p>The Protector’s praiseworthy desire for a union
with Scotland was in part at least subsidiary to his
enthusiasm for the Reformation. The desire to see
Scotland Protestant as well as England was one of his
motives, and a strong one. And for his efforts in the
cause of the New Learning in England he deserves more
praise and less censure than is usually accorded to
him. The historians with what may be called the
anti-Protestant bias rarely distinguish between what
was done under his rule and what was done under
that of his successor in power. Those with a Protestant
bias are apt to condemn him as lukewarm.
Very rarely is it realised that under his government
a degree of toleration prevailed such as was never
contemplated by other Protestant rulers of his times,
still less by Catholic princes. Yet here as in all else
his work was marred by his lack of judgment, and
still more&mdash;unhappily&mdash;by personal defects in his
character.</p>

<p>The religious problem was obviously the most
prominent of those which demanded solution on
the death of Henry VIII. That monarch had
broken with the Papacy, revolutionised the relations
of the State and the ecclesiastical organisation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
England, dissolved the monasteries, appropriated
their revenues, condemned a few superstitious
practices, and authorised a version of the Scriptures
in the vernacular. There he had stopped. No
dogmatic innovations had been admitted, and a
large number of practices which moderate as well as
extreme reformers desired to see altered had been
retained. Obedience had been enforced by stringent
legislation, and the Six Articles Act was a standing
menace to innovators. Still, if in his later years
Henry refused to go forward, he also declined to
go backward. The party of reaction, when they
attempted to subvert Cranmer’s position in the
royal favour, only got a sharp reprimand for their
pains. Yet the Reformation had reached a stage at
which standing still had become impossible.</p>

<p>In framing the list of his executors, it seems as
though the king’s intention had been to preserve a
balance, with a slight leaning towards the forward
school; a leaning which would almost have been
reversed if Gardiner had been included. Cranmer
was balanced by Tunstal, Hertford by Wriothesley.
Dudley, Herbert, and Russell, were avowedly on the
Protestant side. Others were pronounced supporters
of the old order, and others again like Paget would be
guided by circumstances. The moment, however,
that Hertford’s ascendency was assured, it was quite
certain that the forward movement would be set
on foot. Cranmer took in the pulpit the earliest
opportunity of likening the boy-king to Josiah,
thereby very definitely fore-shadowing a war against
“images.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Nevertheless, there was nothing in the way of a
violent revolution instituted. Broadly speaking,
measures of which Cranmer had openly avowed
himself in favour during the late king’s reign were
resorted to perhaps more hastily than was wise.
The Archbishop’s Book of Homilies received the
sanction which Henry had refused to it. Injunctions
based on those of Thomas Cromwell were issued,
chiefly directed against “abused images,” and a
visitation by Royal Commission was presently set on
foot. While Somerset was still in Scotland, Gardiner
and Bonner, the bishops of Winchester and London,
offered some opposition on the ground that these
measures were inconsistent with the later ecclesiastical
legislation of Henry; and both were placed
under easy confinement in the Fleet. So far, however,
there was nothing which could be called innovation;
there was merely a renewal of Cromwell’s
activity on the same lines&mdash;accompanied in practice
by very much the same irreverence and violence.</p>

<p>When Convocation and Parliament met for the
winter, there was no appearance of any violence being
done to ecclesiastical consciences. All the bishops
were Henry’s bishops, not Somerset’s; and though
they did not prove unanimous in Parliament, a
majority of them were favourable to the reforming
measures introduced&mdash;with the exception of the
Chantries Act, which was in itself quite obviously
nothing but the completion of an approved policy.
Acts for the suppression of irreverent language about
the Sacrament, and enjoining the administration of
the Communion in both kinds, were passed actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
at the instance of the clergy themselves, while the
clerical demand for permission to marry was ignored.
The Six Articles Act was repealed, but that was
nothing more than an abolition of penalties, like
the accompanying repeal of the statutes <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de heretico
comburendo</i>. During 1548, there were proclamations
enjoining the Lenten fast, for the sake of the fisheries;
an Order of service for Communion was issued, which,
however, only gave effect to the recent Act; there
was a fresh Injunction against Images; preaching
was restricted to the Homilies, except for licensed
preachers&mdash;a custom frequently enforced in the
last reign. In form, there was still no innovation.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1548&ndash;9 came the First Prayer
Book of Edward VI., and the Act of Uniformity.
The Prayer Book was a compromise, which admitted
of such divergent interpretation that the most and
the least advanced of the bishops could use it
without straining their consciences: and the Act of
Uniformity, while it penalised disobedience on the
part of the clergy, laid no burden whatever upon
laymen.</p>

<p>Now we have here reviewed summarily the whole
of the ecclesiastical legislation for which Somerset
was responsible. On the face of it, the changes he
introduced were by no means revolutionary. Even
the new Prayer Book in effect required no one to
accept any new doctrine. The repeal of penal acts
practically permitted but assuredly did not enforce
the teaching of the doctrines against which they
had been directed. Not a single victim was sent to
the stake; not a single bishop was deprived of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
his See. During Somerset’s absence in Scotland,
Gardiner and Bonner were placed in confinement for
disobeying the Injunctions. Both were released after
some three months. Again, the next year, Gardiner
adopted a critical attitude which led to his being
imprisoned again in what was no doubt a high-handed
fashion; and almost at the moment of the
Protector’s fall, Bonner was again sent to prison
for disobeying the Act of Uniformity. There is
only one other act of persecution charged to Somerset
which even calls for comment, the condemnation of
Joan Bocher; and that is only to remark that as a
matter of fact it was after his fall that her execution
was sanctioned. It was not till he had been ousted
from power by Dudley that the zealots dominated
the reforming party.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in this field also the Protector failed,
and brought discredit both on his measures and his
motives. On his measures, because those which
were in themselves the most questionable and the
most unpopular were, so to express it, not statutory
but proclamatory: exercises of a power which was
of extremely doubtful legality, arbitrary in their
nature. On his motives, because he made large
personal profits out of the spoils of the Church
(though a far larger proportion of these was appropriated
to education than in the preceding reign),
and set an evil example of sacrilege by laying hands
upon sacred edifices and pulling them down for the
building of a palace for himself. In his policy,
which was moderate and most unusually tolerant,
he worked hand-in-hand with the Archbishop, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
that it is difficult to say which of the two was the
guiding spirit; yet its effect was in great part&mdash;though
not, as in the case of Scotland, totally&mdash;destroyed
by the mistaken methods he chose to
adopt for enforcing it.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">SOMERSET AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEM</span></h3>

<p>We have studied the Protector in his character
as prophet of the union with Scotland, and as
apostle of religious tolerance. We have now to
observe him in his third <i>rôle</i> as friend of the people;
wherein again he was equally honest in his pursuit
of an ideal, equally satisfied of his own competence
to deal with the problem, and equally misguided in
his methods.</p>

<p>No man, whatever his office, can be reproached for
having failed to solve the eternal problems of poverty
and unemployment. The enormous discrepancies
in the distribution of wealth may appeal to the
wealthy as evidence of divine justice; by the poor
they are more apt to be attributed to human injustice.
Yet it is not always apparent on the face of
things that the rich man has become rich or the poor
man poor through any misdoings. Natural forces
operate without any regard to abstract equity.
There are always, however, those who, passionately
alive to the unfairness of the inequalities around
them, are convinced that there is nothing to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the realisation of a Utopian rectification except the
selfish greed of the propertied classes, and imagine
that an adequate remedy can be found in the
imposition of paper rules and regulations. Selfish
greed is always one of the factors in the problem, of
varying magnitude, and regulations which effectively
protect the weak instead of strengthening the strong
may have most beneficial results; but they must
have a power behind them which is capable of enforcing
them, and they must be in themselves
capable of being enforced.</p>

<p>The social disorganisation at this period was
exceptionally acute. For the agricultural depression,
we have already noted as the most vital cause
the conversion of arable land into pasture&mdash;the
growing substitution of a highly remunerative industry
demanding little labour for a less remunerative
industry requiring more labour. Next to this was
the disappearance of small holdings, owing to their
accumulation into single large estates&mdash;the substitution
in effect of large farms worked by farm servants
for petty cultivation by peasant households. Third
stands the enclosing and appropriation of common
lands by large landholders. The demand for labour
sinking from these causes out of all proportion to the
supply, cheapened labour excessively. There was an
army of men who could find no employment, and
those who obtained employment were miserably
paid. Of the three causes named, only the third
can be attributed to the moral obliquities of the
wealthy. The other two were natural economic
developments which would in the course of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
find their natural remedy in the growth of new industries
which would absorb the displaced labour.
That, however, did not make the existing distress
less painful, since the new industries had not yet come
into being. Moreover, whereas in the old days the
monasteries had at least played some part in the
immediate relief of distress, though they had not
mitigated its causes, their destruction had abolished
this source of relief. We have in our own day an
analogous movement in the industrial world, public
companies and trusts absorbing the business of the
small traders, while the channels into which capital
flows are decided by considerations not of philanthropy
but of dividends.</p>

<p>The true remedy was to be found&mdash;and was found
in the course of Elizabeth’s reign&mdash;in the development
of new industries; and the condition of developing
new industries was the restoration of public
credit: to be achieved primarily by steady government,
establishing general confidence, and by ending
one grave cause of the existing lack of credit for
which the recent government had been directly
responsible, namely, the debasement of the coinage.
It was also not impracticable, though exceedingly
difficult, to deal with the thievery of common lands.
Incidentally, it was necessary to find a substitute
which should discharge the charitable functions of
the monasteries, as well as to hold in check the
vagabondage which, owing to the great number of
the unemployed, was a daily increasing danger.</p>

<p>There were, then, certain practical steps to be
taken which would not indeed cure the existing evils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
but would serve directly to mitigate them and to
restore the body politic to a condition in which
the only effective remedy could be applied. But in
the sixteenth century, even the most scientific
thinkers believed that human nature could be
“expelled with a fork” by statute: and it is small
blame to Somerset that he sought to stay the economic
tide and to forbid the inevitable. The attempt
was very much more than anything else the cause of
his ruin; and as usual it was dictated by the most
excellent motives. But it is very much to be
lamented that while he attempted the impracticable,
he left what was practicable alone, or mismanaged
it so far as he did try it. He could not
provide the country with a steady government:
he did not restore the currency: public credit sank.
He pinned his faith on legislation which was either
flatly rejected or became a dead letter the moment
it was passed. He made an attempt to deal with
vagabondage by converting vagabonds into slaves,
which was merely grotesque. Dissatisfied&mdash;quite
properly&mdash;with the courts which dealt with the
land questions, he established a “Court of Requests”
in his own house, and proposed on his own responsibility
to overrule their decisions. As for the enclosure
business, the Council was not merely unsympathetic;
half its members were more or less
flagrant enclosers themselves. For Somerset to
make a direct frontal attack on the system on which
they were battening was creditable to his courage,
but it was not politics. When they found that the
Protector was not merely playing at being a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
ruler, but was taking himself very seriously indeed,
and that he evinced anything but the proper desire
to pulverise the Commons when they rose in arms
either in the western or the eastern counties, they
were not long in deciding that the Protector himself
must go. They were only following immemorial
custom when they put forward the theory that he
was seeking his own advancement by practising the
arts of the demagogue, and that the rural unrest was
the creation of his machinations.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LORD ADMIRAL</span></h3>

<p>The same characteristics of the Protector present
themselves in other fields. His motives were quite
other than those which actuated the government
which succeeded his, and on an altogether higher plane.
We have already noted in passing that his scheme
for religion included the repeal of the Act of the Six
Articles and the old penal statutes <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de heretico comburendo</i>;
that is, his policy abolished the methods of
persecution, at least in any stringent form. In precisely
the same spirit, he dealt with the Treason Laws
invented under Henry VIII. and used by that
monarch with such terrible effect. Those laws were
a very potent weapon in the hands of an arbitrary
ruler; an instrument by which virtually the king&mdash;or,
if the king so chose, his minister&mdash;could absolutely
secure the condemnation for high treason of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
person who in any way proved obnoxious to his
government. To that end it was practically sufficient
to procure an information that the proposed victim
had used expressions which might be construed as
implying a possibility of treasonous intent, or of
complicity in treasonous intent&mdash;treasonous intent
being interpreted in the widest conceivable sense&mdash;and
the victim’s doom was sealed, whether he were
a Buckingham, a More, or a Surrey. This weapon
lay ready to the Protector’s hand for the destruction
of rivals and the establishment of his own authority.
He not only declined to use it; he broke it to pieces
himself. It is particularly noteworthy that it was
in Somerset’s Act of 1547 that a provision was first
introduced requiring that any charge of treason
should be supported by two witnesses&mdash;a provision
repeated in the later Treasons Act of Northumberland.
The Protector deliberately and of set purpose
deprived himself of those means to tyranny which
Thomas Cromwell had so carefully fabricated.</p>

<p>Again, we find during his rule that there was no
coercing of Parliament, no interference with freedom
of debate, no danger attending on the most outspoken
opposition to the personal wishes of the Protector.</p>

<p>Yet here, again, he gave occasion to the enemy. If
he had maintained the Cromwellian system of
ruthlessness in the pursuit of each object he set
before himself, his condemnation as a tyrant would
have been tempered by praise of his masterfulness.
The policy of blood and iron always has its advocates,
and sometimes merits advocacy. But it was not
Somerset’s policy, and therefore the one occasion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
which he deserted his practice attracts criticism. On
that one occasion there is very little doubt that he
had an irresistible case. It is scarcely necessary to
add that he did the thing the wrong way.</p>

<p>His brother William, created Lord Seymour of
Sudely under the new administration, was also Lord
High Admiral. But, as the king’s uncle, he was by
no means satisfied with the honours which fell to his
share, and was extremely jealous of his brother’s
absorption of dignities and power. He plunged
in a series of intrigues to get the young king under
his own personal influence, and to bring the two
younger girls, Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey, who
might come into the succession, under his own control.
He began by secretly marrying Katharine Parr, the
king’s widow, for whose hand he had been a suitor
before Henry had chosen her for his sixth matrimonial
venture: so that his wife had precedence
over Somerset’s Duchess. Elizabeth, being under
her charge, was thus brought into the Admiral’s
household. He bribed Dorset, whose wife under
Henry’s will stood next in succession to Henry’s
own offspring, to place their daughter Jane under
his tutelage also. He put forward a claim that, as
the king’s uncle, he was entitled to be governor of
the king’s person instead of his brother, who was
Protector of the realm&mdash;a claim in which he was
unsupported. He consistently set himself in opposition
to his brother, doing everything in his power to
thwart him, and refusing to command the fleet which
accompanied the invasion of Scotland. Katharine
Parr died within eighteen months of her marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
and no sooner was she in her grave than he attempted
to obtain the hand of Elizabeth, now a girl of barely
fifteen years: to whom his behaviour had already
been so objectionable that Katharine had found it
necessary to remove her out of his reach. As
Admiral, instead of repressing the pirates who
infested the Channel, he made private league with
them for their support&mdash;and for shares in their booty.
He kept something like a small army of bravoes in his
pay, and had a private cannon-foundry of his own;
and he found the means for the heavy expenditure
entailed through a pact with Sharrington, the master
of the mint at Bristol, who was pocketing enormous
and iniquitous profits out of the clipping and debasing
of the coins he issued.</p>

<p>With Henry on the throne, or a Thomas Cromwell
at the head of the State, the Lord Admiral would
have been in the Tower in two months. Under the
Protectorate, he was allowed to carry on his intrigues
and malpractices for two years, with nothing more
serious than remonstrances. The discovery, however,
of Sharrington’s frauds and Seymour’s implication
therein brought matters to a head. The evidence,
not only of an abuse of his office which amounted to
treason, but of an ulterior intention of subverting
the Government, was ample enough, though the only
prominent men who were in any sense attached to
him were Dorset and Northampton (the latter being
Katharine Parr’s brother). There is hardly a question
that, in open trial, under the most favourable
conditions, the Admiral would have been sentenced
and executed. Unfortunately for his own credit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Somerset assented to the view of the Council that
the process should be by attainder in Parliament
instead. Seymour stood on his right to an open
hearing, and refused to answer the interrogatories of
committees of the Council or of the Peers; and therefore
he was condemned, by the almost unanimous
verdict of both houses, unheard. The natural
result was that men said at the time, and have continued
to say since, that the Protector, fearing that
his brother might become a dangerous rival, fabricated
charges against him, and in effect contrived one
more of the political murders of the type so familiar
in the annals of Henry VIII. The Admiral was
executed in March. His death was undoubtedly a
shock to popular sentiment, and weakened Somerset’s
position, so that his fall followed the more easily
after the rural risings which turned the majority of
the Council decisively against him.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EX-PROTECTOR</span></h3>

<p>The Council’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’état</i> cost very little trouble.
The moment was seized, when the unsuspecting
Somerset was at Hampton Court, Cranmer and Paget
being absent; while Russell and Herbert were
returning with victorious laurels and most of the
available army from the suppression of the Western
rising. Both of them had strong feelings as to
Somerset’s Enclosures policy. After a futile appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
to the people, there was nothing to do but surrender.
But the Duke was at any rate a popular favourite;
a good many of those who were in the plot against
him liked him well enough personally though his
policy annoyed them; he was not of the stuff of
which successful political plotters are made; there
was no plausible excuse for treating anything that
he had done as proving anything worse than
incompetence; and the Council were satisfied by
his being turned out of office, subjected to a brief
imprisonment, and deprived of no great amount of
his lands. Six months after his fall he was even
readmitted to the Privy Council, as Southampton
had been three years before. There was, in short, no
display of animosity; but the Warwick faction
meant to grasp the management of public affairs, and
to conduct them with more profit to themselves than
the Protector’s <i>régime</i> permitted.</p>

<p>Warwick and his friends&mdash;the Earl did not get himself
created Duke of Northumberland till two years
later&mdash;took over the control in October 1549. They
retained it for a little less than four years. During
that time their foreign and Scottish policy showed
no improvement upon that of Somerset. In matters
of religion, they progressed from the Prayer-book
of 1548&ndash;49 to that of 1552: which would have been
of a more pronounced Calvinistic flavour than it was
but for the moderating influence of Ridley and Cranmer.
Bonner and Gardiner were both deprived of
their sees at the beginning of the <i>régime</i>, and later
Tunstal, Day, and Heath were also imprisoned and
deprived. The new appointments were all advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Reformers. Before Somerset’s fall the Princess Mary
had been attacked for persisting in the use of the
Mass in private, after the Act of Uniformity, but the
Protector granted her a licence to continue. The
Warwick government was not similarly complaisant.
And when a second Act of Uniformity
was passed, of a much narrower type than the first,
laymen as well as clergy were penalised for failure to
conform. In dealing with the rural troubles Somerset’s
policy was reversed, legislation being directed
to the coercive repression of discontent and the
relaxation of such safeguards as existed against
the rapacity of landlords. To this must be added
their new treason law, which not only extended the
same protection to all Privy Councillors as to the
king himself, but also made assemblies “for altering
the laws” high treason, while renewing the requirement
of two witnesses as well as of a time-limit
which Somerset had introduced.</p>

<p>Yet there are historians who say that there is no
need to differentiate between the policy of Somerset
and his successor&mdash;associating them in the same
condemnation.</p>

<p>Somerset, restored to liberty and formally reconciled
to Warwick, consistently endeavoured to use
his influence in mitigation of the rigours of the new
Government, whose chief began to fear, not without
reason, that the moderate men might draw together
and reinstate his rival. Paget, whose abilities made
him dangerous, was removed from the Council, and
imprisoned on an inadequate pretext in the autumn
of 1551, to simplify the carrying out of Warwick’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
plot; evidence of an alleged conspiracy was carefully
concocted, Somerset and several of his friends were
arrested, and the torture&mdash;never employed by the
Protector&mdash;was resorted to for the extraction of
confessions from some of the prisoners. A mythical
assassination plot was dropped out of the indictment.
Finding that even the concocted evidence
was quite inadequate for a conviction of treason,
Northumberland magnanimously declined to press
personal charges, and Somerset was found guilty of
felony&mdash;apparently on the ground that he had
incited the citizens of London to rebellion&mdash;by
a carefully packed court.</p>

<p>Having been acquitted of treason, but&mdash;with
equal satisfaction to Northumberland, since the
penalty was the same&mdash;condemned for felony, the
axe borne by Somerset’s gaolers was reversed when
he was taken from the judgment-hall. The crowds
which had gathered to await the verdict were thus
misled into the belief that the trial had gone in his
favour, and broke into a clamour of rejoicing. It
was a fond illusion. Even when his doom was made
known the populace refused to believe that it
would be carried out. The Duke himself knew better.
As he stood on the scaffold, having already pronounced
his moving and dignified dying speech, a
messenger was seen approaching, and a wild cry
arose&mdash;a delighted shout that he was carrying a
pardon. Somerset hushed the people, warning them
it was no such thing, and bidding them pray with
him for the King’s Majesty. Then, with the words
“Lord Jesus, save me,” he laid his head on the block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
to receive the fatal stroke: and the spectators
hastened to dip their kerchiefs in his blood, to be
preserved as memorials of one who, with all his
faults, had won the heart’s love of the common
folk.</p>

<p>Somerset’s personal faults were shared by the
majority of the prominent men of his time; it was
only the greatness of his position which made them
a shade more conspicuous in him. As a statesman,
he was a melancholy failure; <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">capax imperii</i> he was
not in any possible sense; and his incapacity was
only the more conclusively proved by the fact that
he never suspected it himself. The shrewdest of
men would have found it difficult enough to realise
his aims, and of shrewdness he had not a particle.
His failure was due not less to his complete lack of
judgment than to the difficulties inherent in the
problems which with easy confidence he set himself
to solve. It was an ill thing for England that he was
not a wiser man. But it had been well for England
if wiser men than he had possessed more of those
moral qualities of his to which he himself so woefully
failed to give effect.</p>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>

<p>The Protector Somerset accounted himself a statesman.
Of his own choice, he grasped at power;
and being unfitted for it, he broke down disastrously.
Thomas Cranmer affords a striking contrast. He
was dragged into the turmoil of public affairs, in
the vortex of the Reformation; against his will, he
was compelled to accept ecclesiastical responsibilities
which were in themselves semi-political, and to play
a part also in affairs which were political exclusively.
In the second capacity, he never assumed the direction,
but was merely called upon to assent to the
actions of others; but as archbishop he was compelled
willy nilly to be a protagonist in the religious
revolution&mdash;a term covering not only changes in
the authorised doctrines of the Church and the
authorised practices of the clergy, but in the relations
of the clerical organisation in England both
to the clerical organisation of Christendom and the
secular powers at home.</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by</i> <span class="smcap">G. Fliccius</span> <i>in the National Portrait Gallery</i></p></div></div>

<p>In the eyes of an earnest school of ecclesiastical
critics, he proved himself a traitor to the sacred
trust which was imposed on him; a time-serving tool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of lay usurpers; who, if he had convictions, lacked
the courage of them, disowning all that he had most
strongly avowed to save himself from the stake;
and only at the last in some measure redeeming
himself by a belated and almost incomprehensible
courage in the hour of his doom. Ardent Protestants
endorse half the charges, and condemn him as at
best a Laodicean, though one who found grace at
the eleventh hour. And historians who display no
marked bias on the ecclesiastical questions are apt
almost to pass him by, with contemptuous reference
to his weakness and subserviency. Still there are not
a few who have studied his career with care and
sympathy; and their verdict is by no means the
one conventionally accepted. It would, indeed, be
strange and sad if such a verdict gave a true account
of the man who did more than any other individual,
on the one hand, to preserve the continuity of the
Church, while, on the other hand, he strove to make
her comprehensive and national. To no one, indeed,
can he assume the proportions of a master-spirit;
but the more closely we study him, the more
readily we recognise in him a pre-eminently gentle
and charitable soul, simple and sincere, striving
to do his duty through good and evil report, in a
task which he would fain have left to men who were
not&mdash;as he was&mdash;born to be students, not fighters;
and actually accomplishing what men of far greater
practical ability would have deemed it vain to
attempt. If it was better for England that the
Church should be what it became than that it
should have taken the shape into which either a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Gardiner or a Knox would have moulded it, it was
well for England that for twenty years Cranmer was
her foremost ecclesiastic.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">CRANMER AT CAMBRIDGE</span></h3>

<p>Thomas Cranmer was born not two years before
Henry VIII., in 1489; the son of a country gentleman
of no great estate. An elder son was to carry
on the family; Thomas and his younger brother
were destined to the Church. The younger sons of a
country gentleman of straitened means had no very
encouraging prospects, and the career chosen for
the boy was, no doubt, dictated merely by convenience,
though it was well enough suited to his
talents and temperament. Somewhat lacking, perhaps,
in that cheerful heedlessness of danger and
physical pain which is the happy heritage of the
normal English boy&mdash;the outcome often of rude
health and imperturbable nerves rather than of
any properly moral endowment&mdash;a certain timidity
and want of self-confidence in him were evidently
fostered by the unsympathetic severity of a pedagogue
whose theory of education was, a stick with a master
at one end and a boy at the other. In due course
he went up to the recent foundation of Jesus College,
Cambridge, and was elected to a fellowship on taking
his degree. Till his fortieth year he continued in
these academic shades, and would have remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
there peacefully enough to his life’s end if an
accident had not brought him under the notice of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Colet and others, some years earlier, had introduced
the new criticism into Oxford; while Cranmer
was an undergraduate, Cambridge was still lagging
behind. In 1511, however, the placid, not to say
stagnant, waters were moved by the appointment
of Erasmus to the Greek Chair. There is no record
of any personal intercourse between Cranmer and
the great scholar; but it was precisely at this time
that the former withdrew his attention from the
scholastic philosophy and theology which had hitherto
absorbed him, and devoted himself to studying the
Scriptures. In the University he seems to have been
regarded as an undoubtedly learned scholar; for
Wolsey, who as an educationist chose his men with
judgment, offered him a canonry at his new “Cardinal
College” at Oxford; but he was not looked upon as
one who would seek preferment or be selected for it
unsought, or as in any sense an intellectual leader.
The only incident worth noting is that at the outset,
being still a layman, he lost his fellowship by marrying
a respectable young “gentlewoman,” a connexion of
the landlord of a Cambridge hostelry. On her death,
however, a year later, he was re-elected to his fellowship&mdash;apparently
a unique instance in those times of
such recognition&mdash;proceeding afterwards to take
Holy Orders.</p>

<p>Now, in those early days, the intelligence and
ability, not only of laymen, but of the greatest
ecclesiastics were all on the side of the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
emancipation of which Erasmus was the apostle.
Archbishop Warham was the scholar’s patron, Fox
of Winchester was his warm admirer, Fisher of
Rochester had given him his Cambridge appointment.
From his disciples Wolsey chose the men
for the great college which was his favourite scheme
outside of pure politics. Colet, Dean of St. Paul’s,
and Thomas More, were among his closest friends.
No one of any account thought of receiving with
anything but the warmest welcome his edition of the
Greek Testament and the <i>Utopia</i> of More, which
appeared about the same time. Then a somewhat
startling event occurred. The Pope wanted money;
he sent out commissioners to obtain it by the sale
of indulgences; and a monk at Wittenberg rose up
and publicly denounced the whole scheme. At first,
the meaning of the portent was not fully appreciated;
but before long the denunciation of indulgences
developed into a challenge of the entire Papal
system, of the pretensions of the Popes, and of
sundry accepted dogmas. Reformation by the
influence of sweetness and light was by no means the
same thing as this volcanic revolution. The men
who had done so much to make the new movement
possible became eager to repress it. The
English king plunged into theological controversy,
triumphantly vindicating the Papacy and pulverising
the monk of Wittenberg.</p>

<p>Before many years had passed, however, Henry
found reason to modify his views, as More had warned
him he might do. Papal pretensions stood in the
way of royal designs, and that fact brought it home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to him that those pretensions were not based upon a
rock. The Bishop of Rome was also a European
potentate subject to political pressure from other
potentates&mdash;a political factor with a spiritual sanction.
If the spiritual sanction were challenged, the
political situation would be simplified. The king’s
authority in his own dominions would no longer
be trammeled by the claims of a foreign authority to
over-ride it. When a collision between the royal and
the Papal authority became imminent, it was time
to be rid of the Papacy for good and all. That, of
course, was quite a different thing from admitting
heretical dogmas or denials of dogma.</p>

<p>The occasion was the <span class="locked">divorce<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> of Katharine of
Aragon. If the Pope had been amenable in that
matter, Henry would in all likelihood have left the
Papal authority where he found it. But Clement,
terrorised by the Emperor, was not amenable&mdash;despite
the efforts of Wolsey. The collapse of the
legatine trial ruined Wolsey and decided the king
on a campaign with the object of establishing the
Crown as the sole head of the Spirituality; involving
the withdrawal or repudiation of the Papal claims
and the formal subjection of the clergy in England.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C" id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> This customary term for the proceedings has been used throughout.
But it may be necessary to note that a “decree of nullity”&mdash;the
thing sought&mdash;is not properly speaking a “divorce” at all.
Nullity means that no marriage had in fact been contracted; divorce,
that a marriage which had been contracted is dissolved.</p></div>

<p>The trial had just collapsed. Henry in dudgeon
retired to Waltham. Two of his suite, his almoner
Fox and his secretary Stephen Gardiner, took up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
quarters with a Mr. Cressy, in whose house Dr.
Cranmer happened to be residing, as the son’s tutor.
Gardiner and Fox, being also respectively Provost
and Master of King’s and Trinity Hall, were acquainted
with Cranmer; and together they naturally
discussed what was known as “the king’s affair.”
In the course of conversation Cranmer expressed
himself to the effect that Henry could do without the
Papal decision. He could obtain from the universities
of Europe the opinion of the qualified divines
on the question whether a Papal dispensation for a
marriage with a deceased brother’s widow was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra
vires</i>; and take corresponding action on his own
responsibility when he learnt the result. The
English courts, in short, were competent to pronounce
the marriage null or valid, but the position
would be made impregnable if they had the expert
opinion of Europe to go upon. The conversation
was reported to Henry, who caught at the scheme
and summoned its deviser to talk to him. Their interview
terminated Cranmer’s hitherto undisturbed
prospect of passing his days in peaceful and learned
seclusion; such an instrument as this was not to be
wasted. Unscrupulous loyalty Henry knew by
experience he could command; servants of the type
which provided it could be used till the last ounce of
service had been extracted from them, and then cast
aside. But Henry wanted a man of undeniable
learning, unblemished character, a tender conscience,
a convenient theory of Church and State, and a
certain impressibility. The combination was not
easily found&mdash;but he had found it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">RISE TO THE ARCHBISHOPRIC</span></h3>

<p>The common animosity towards Cranmer of
those who hold “high” doctrines on the function of
the priesthood is entirely intelligible. For them,
the divine revelation is entrusted to the Church, and
the voice of the Church is the voice of her priesthood.
Its authority is absolute, and secular powers seeking
to control it are laying profane hands on the Ark
of the Covenant. That laymen should not humbly
recognise that august claim is deplorable; still,
for laymen some excuse may be found. But that a
priest should not merely disavow it in words, but
emphasise the disavowal by his acts, aiding and
abetting the desecration as well as justifying it,
is intolerable. When, moreover, that priest is himself,
as it were, the shepherd of the whole flock, whose
position demands that he above all others should be
the guardian and champion of the Church’s rights,
he becomes a double-dyed traitor. Palpably guilty
of so heinous a crime, the presumption in favour of
the truth of any minor charges against him is so
strong that it is hardly necessary to examine them:
they may almost be taken for granted.</p>

<p>If, indeed, it be unpardonable to believe that the
State is supreme, there can be no pardon for Cranmer.
But if once it be admitted that a man is not of
necessity a moral reprobate for holding that view,
and that it is possible, even for a priest, to maintain
it with entire honesty and sincerity, the whole fabric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of Cranmer’s condemnation collapses. To Cranmer,
the State meant the king, and in the king he found an
authority more divine&mdash;more definitely, that is, of
divine sanction&mdash;than in any other of the powers
that be. When in Queen Mary’s reign he found the
royal authority in flat opposition to what he held to
be truth, no doubt a very painful and puzzling
dilemma presented itself; but the same dilemma is
presented to every individual who, having recognised
some external authority as final, suddenly
discovers that the dictates of that authority and
those of his own conscience are in flat contradiction.</p>

<p>Cranmer, in short, was as complete and convinced
an Erastian as any layman could possibly have been.
It was the clear perception of that fact which
primarily made Henry select him as Archbishop
Warham’s successor. A frankly Erastian archbishop
was an anomaly, but it is not necessary <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> to
condemn him as a criminal and a hypocrite, or even
as a time-server.</p>

<p>Cranmer, like a good many other people, was
thoroughly convinced that, though the marriage
with Katharine had been effected in perfect good
faith, it was invalid in the nature of things, and
could not be made valid by any sort of ecclesiastical
sanction, Papal or other. The king set him to work
to formulate a plea for nullity, and placed him under
the immediate influence of the Boleyn household,
where the simple man very readily learnt to form the
highest opinion of the lady whom the king had determined
to make a queen. Then he was sent with
Anne’s father on a futile embassy to Bologna; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
not long after his return he was again despatched as
an enemy to Germany, where he made many friends
but did not succeed in gaining many converts to his
view on the divorce question. There also he took
the extremely uncanonical step of marrying; but
it must be remembered that while such marriages
among the secular clergy were not recognised by
the law, they were not regarded as offences against
morality, and were by no means infrequent; while
in Germany itself they had become, or were becoming,
the rule rather than the exception. Cranmer was
still in Germany when he received the unexpected
and most unwelcome summons to return to England
and take upon himself the ungrateful honour of the
archbishopric.</p>

<p>In the meantime Henry’s “Reformation” parliament
had been at work; the campaign against the
Pope and the clerical organisation was in full swing:
and Convocation, under the aged Warham, had been
compelled to affirm the royal supremacy. The
“submission of the clergy” had become an accomplished
fact in Cranmer’s absence, and before he held
any position of high authority. The most stubborn
of the bishops were unable to resist the pressure of
the Crown. They bowed to the logic of facts,
under protest and against their convictions, without
being condemned as subservient. Cranmer is called
subservient mainly because his convictions were on
the king’s side.</p>

<p>It was always more agreeable to Henry to employ
on any job he had in hand men to whom that
particular job was not distasteful. Thus, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Sir Thomas More’s sentiments as to the divorce,
he had given the new Chancellor no business in connexion
with it. It is not likely that any of the
bishops at this time, with the exception of Fisher,
would have felt strongly as to a breach with Rome&mdash;Gardiner
and Stokesly were both advocates of the
divorce. But it was more convenient to have an
archbishop as to whose sentiments there was no
manner of doubt. It is not impossible that Gardiner,
not Cranmer, would have been chosen, if his
attitude in regard to the “Supplication against the
Ordinaries” and the “Submission” of Convocation
had not made Henry scent in him a possible Becket.
The Bishop of Winchester’s services had been of
considerable value; and if Cranmer’s appointment
stirred his jealousy, he can hardly be blamed. But
it is scarcely to be doubted that a personal antagonism
to the rival, for whose first preferment to Henry’s
notice he had himself been in part responsible and
by whom he now found himself superseded, exercised
a marked influence on Gardiner’s attitude from this
time.</p>

<p>Cranmer, summoned home, delayed on the way as
much as he dared&mdash;in the hope, it is said, that the
king might be persuaded to change his mind and
make another selection. However, he arrived in
January; Henry&mdash;for his own ends&mdash;put pressure on
the Pope to hasten the necessary bulls, and the new
Archbishop was consecrated on March 30 (1533). An
oath of obedience to the Pope was a necessary part
of the ceremony. Such oaths are commonly regarded
as mere formalities, binding precisely so long as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
is convenient to recognise them. Cranmer, however,
being very well aware that whosoever became archbishop
would very soon find it necessary to ignore the
oath or else to defy the king, was at pains to announce
beforehand that he only intended to respect the oath
so far as it consorted with obedience to the king&mdash;a
declaration which has been rather oddly condemned
as hypocritical. Oaths and <span class="locked">promises<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></span> made purely
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro forma</i> are a not very excusable institution, but
the open profession that they are made <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro forma</i>
only makes such hypocrisy as is involved less, not
greater.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D" id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> How many godparents or brides, for instance, regard the

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">HENRY’S PRIMATE</span></h3>

<p>The first business before Cranmer was to finish
off the affair of the divorce. Henry had already&mdash;whether
in the previous November or January&mdash;been
privately married to Anne Boleyn. On the theory
that the marriage with Katharine was void <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab initio</i>,
there was never any bar to another marriage, though
it was hardly possible to announce one until the
nullity had been formally declared: so that any
further delay was certain to cause a public scandal&mdash;since
it was now April, and Elizabeth was born in the
following September. Convocation had already pronounced
in favour of Henry’s view; and if Cranmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
was somewhat anxious to evade possible obstructions,
it was only because the decision of the court was by
this time a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>For the destruction of More and Fisher (1534&ndash;1535)
Cranmer was in no sort of way responsible. He
was on the Commission which had to administer
the Oath of Supremacy, which the two recalcitrants
declined, but it was not he who prescribed the form
of the oath, nor had he anything to say to the
penalties. All he did do was to urge the king to
accept as sufficient a form of the oath to which
Fisher and More were both prepared to subscribe.</p>

<p>Something more is usually made of the Archbishop’s
conduct at the time of Anne Boleyn’s
fall, as an instance of the subserviency which is
imputed to him. It is argued that officially at
Henry’s bidding he condemned the unhappy lady,
while personally convinced of her innocence. The
whole story is enveloped in an obscurity which
makes that impression a natural one; nevertheless,
the most probable explanation of the circumstances
is one which fairly exonerates the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Henry had sought to have the nullity of the
marriage with Katharine established ostensibly
for two main reasons. The first was the fruit of
conscience, that the union, though sanctioned by
the Pope, was against the moral law. The second
was a reason of State, that a male heir to the throne
with an indisputable title was a necessity, and
therefore the king must be provided with another
wife than Katharine. The other wife he had chosen
was Anne Boleyn, but she had failed to do what
was expected of her. Like her predecessor, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
had borne a daughter, and had two miscarriages
Henry was tired of her, and was attracted to another
lady whose virtue was impregnable; therefore he
wanted to be rid of her in turn. Charges of treason
on the ground of post-nuptial immorality were
brought against her, and on these she was condemned
by a court of peers composed in great part
of those who would have been readiest to welcome
her acquittal. Here, we have nothing to do with
the truth or falsehood of the allegations; Cranmer
was not one of the judges, and had nothing whatever
to do with the trial. But Anne had from the first
shown him the best side of her character, and
he had a perfect conviction that she was a good
woman. He could not influence the court; he
had nothing which could be called evidence in
her favour to bring forward. The king’s wishes
were obvious. Yet Cranmer took the somewhat
bold step of addressing the king, pleading earnestly
and even passionately on her behalf&mdash;though vainly.</p>

<p>But, for reasons best known to himself, Henry
was not satisfied with a condemnation for treason:
he also required a divorce&mdash;or, to express it more
correctly, a declaration that the marriage, like
that with Katharine, had been void from the beginning.
How could Cranmer, who had officially
declared it valid, now make any such pronouncement?
The answer is, that the technical ground on
which it was voided had not previously been taken into
account. The story of a pre-contract with Northumberland
need not count for much, though for the
avoidance of scandal it was put in the forefront.
The charges on which Anne was condemned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
death, while effective for proper divorce proceedings,
were irrelevant to the question of nullity.
The real ground was that at an earlier stage Henry
had illicit relations with Anne’s elder sister, Mary,
thereby technically creating affinity with Anne,
and rendering the marriage with her void by canon
law. How far Cranmer knew or suspected this
unofficially, when he declared the marriage valid,
is a matter of doubt&mdash;which is not set at rest by
his pamphlet in favour of the divorce. But, being
now officially informed of it, he could not maintain
the technical validity of the marriage any longer.
His view of the importance of merely canonical prohibitions
is illustrated by his own uncanonical
marriage. Even if he knew of the “affinity” he
would probably have accounted it no moral bar
to a union. But, knowing it, he could not deny
that it made the marriage technically invalid. It
is, perhaps, worth noting that his plea for Anne’s
life contains a reference to Henry’s own morals,
which may very well have been a reminder that it
was the king’s sin, not Anne’s, which had placed
her in a false position. As for her actual guilt or
innocence under the other accusations, the Primate
could not protest against the king or the judges
being persuaded by the evidence, but he could,
and did, declare that, not having the evidence
before him, he could not bring himself to believe
that the charges were true: but that did not touch
the question of nullity. Whoever deserved blame
over the affair, Cranmer did not.</p>

<p>Some years later Thomas Cromwell was struck
down by his master. His government had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
in many respects a reign of terror. The populace
had no affection for him; the nobles hated him:
the new men, even those he had made, feared
him; the king’s wrath was kindled against him.
The downfall of Wolsey had not been more universally
acceptable. But there was one man who
lifted up his voice to plead for the fallen minister&mdash;Thomas
Cranmer, the time-server. As in the
case of Anne Boleyn, it was impossible for him
to take up the cudgels in defence of the man who
had been less dangerous, perhaps, to him than to
most others&mdash;dangerous he was to every one, for
he spared neither friend nor foe&mdash;but who else
would have dared, or ever did dare, to appeal to
Henry in the day of his wrath?</p>

<p>It was not Cranmer who directed the course of
the Reformation under Henry. The breach with
Rome in all its completeness was devised and
carried out without aid from him, unless the suggestion
of taking the opinion of the Universities on the
divorce is to be counted as aid. Before the king
had ever heard of Cranmer, Gardiner had told
Clement in plain terms that if he refused to entertain
the English king’s wishes England would repudiate
his jurisdiction altogether. The great majority of
the bishops were no friends to the Papal claims,
though some of them would have taken a different
line if they had not been too late in discovering
that the king meant to impose his own yoke instead
of the Pope’s: and the same thing might be said
of Convocation generally. Gardiner and Stokesley,
the most persistent of Cranmer’s antagonists, had
been foremost in supporting the king against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Pope. The clergy had writhed and resisted when
the attack was turned against themselves by the
“Supplication against the Ordinaries,” but they
had been forced to surrender and make their “Submission”
while Warham was still Archbishop and
Cranmer was engaged in other matters. Even
after he became Primate Cranmer had no actual
hand or voice in the great despoiling measures
which accompanied the dissolution of the monasteries;
while the downfall of the monastic system
in itself was probably not unwelcome to the bulk
of the secular clergy, between whom and the regulars
there was constant friction and jealousy.</p>

<p>In this connexion, however, while Cranmer, like
Gardiner and the rest, neither aided nor hindered
Cromwell’s work, it ought to stand to his eternal
credit that he was almost alone in protesting, not
against the spoliation itself&mdash;practically no one
seems to have ventured to do that&mdash;but against
the misuse of the wealth which thus changed hands.
He wrote to Cromwell emphatically expressing his
grief and disappointment that those funds were not
appropriated to education&mdash;still accounted one of
the primary functions of the Church. Had the
course which he urged been followed there would
have been little possibility of saying that the Church
was robbed. But Cromwell and his master had
other uses for the spoils. It is remarkable, too,
that when educational establishments were endowed
Cranmer made a vigorous stand on behalf of humble
scholars against those who would have confined
their benefits to the sons of the well-to-do.</p>

<p>So far, however, as concerned matters of doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
and practice the Archbishop exercised some influence.
His sojourn in Germany had not made
him a Lutheran, but it had inclined him to give
favourable consideration to the opinions of sober
reformers on the Continent. Viewing the Papacy
as the enemy, he was always sanguine of the possibility
that a common standard of doctrine might
be formulated in consultation with the Protestant
leaders; and such an agreement was a pet project
of his, the theological counterpart of Cromwell’s
political league with the Lutherans. Henry, however,
looked askance on both schemes, and the
Archbishop’s efforts were doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Anxious as Cranmer was for a union of the
opponents of Papacy, there were many disputable
points on which his own judgment had not crystallised.
In the matter, however, on which he
really laid most stress he got his way. An English
Bible which all men might read was the desire of
his heart, and that was the one innovation of first-rate
importance to which Henry acceded. The
first Convocation over which he presided petitioned
for a commission to prepare such a volume, and
the petition was granted. The Commission itself
was ineffective enough; some of the members, like
Stokesley, desired only to obstruct the work as far
as in them lay. But the principle was conceded,
and the Commission was made superfluous by
the appearance of Coverdale’s and “Matthew’s”
versions. There is no doubt at all that the main
credit is due to Cranmer, though his efforts would
have been vain enough without the powerful support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of Cromwell. A kindred concession to Cranmer’s
enthusiasm for the English language was the
authorisation, in Henry’s later years, of an English
Litany.</p>

<p>When John Frith affirmed the proposition that a
correct belief on the subject of the Eucharist could
not be essential to salvation, there were few, if any,
of his contemporaries who did not regard him as
an anarchist in religion. But the subject of the
Eucharist was only one among many as to which
men were in a state of great uncertainty concerning
the belief which should be regarded as correct. A
standard was wanted; it might be rigid, or it might
be elastic. Given a standard fixed by authority,
no one was prepared as yet to admit that the individual
was at liberty to set up a different standard
for himself: no one doubted that the lack of an
authoritative standard was an evil. Hence arose
the efforts in Henry’s reign to evolve acceptable
formularies, which should define what must be
acknowledged as true doctrines.</p>

<p>In the devising of these Cranmer, as well as many
others, had his share. They did not express the views
of any one man&mdash;unless it were the king&mdash;or any one
party. They were three in number: first, the “Ten
Articles” for “establishing Christian quietness”;
then the “Institution of a Christian Man,” commonly
called the <i>Bishop’s Book</i>; and some years later the
“Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian
Man,” known as the <i>King’s Book</i>. Between the first
and the last there is no definite change of doctrinal
attitude. None of the three breaks away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
received opinion; they differ mainly in the precision
with which certain points are insisted upon. Thus,
in the first, the doctrine of the Real Presence is
affirmed, but not explicitly in the form of Transubstantiation.
The movement is rather towards
rigidity. Cranmer and some of his colleagues made
tentative suggestions in favour of admitting more
advanced views, which were not approved, and in
the case of the King’s Book, it is clear that the
opposing party hoped to get something of a much
more decisively reactionary character.</p>

<p>Cranmer was a long way from being an Anselm,
a Becket, or a Langton. But on the whole, taking
together the history of those three formularies, and
adding that of the Six Articles Act, which intervened,
the surprising thing about him is not his subserviency,
but the persistency with which he defended his own
views. The “Whip with Six Strings” was a tightening
of the bonds which came upon the advanced
party with a startling shock. Cranmer fought the
Bill in Parliament, and he fought some of its positions
in convocation after the king’s mind was very
well known. By the king’s desire, he put his
argument down in black-and-white for the royal
perusal after the Act had become law&mdash;a manifestly
dangerous step. When the “King’s Book” was in
hand, he again fought, though unsuccessfully, for
the admission of views which the Act condemned;
and he told Henry with perfect candour that,
although he obeyed the law as in duty bound, his
opinion remained unaltered. Throughout all the
discussions he criticised the royal suggestions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
comments with an admirable frankness which none
of his colleagues ventured to display.</p>

<p>The curious thing is that Cranmer was the one
man who could say what he would to the king
without arousing his anger, as Cromwell remarked
to him with not unkindly envy: but he could not
deflect the monarch from the path he chose by a
single hair’s breadth. Twice after Cromwell’s fall
the reactionaries fancied that they had the Archbishop
fairly in the toils; both times they were
brought up with a round turn by their master and
his. The combination of ruthless force with great
intellectual power in both Cromwell and Henry found
by contrast a strange attraction in the Primate’s
guilelessness. “Oh, Lord God,” exclaimed Henry
on one occasion, “what fond simplicity have you,
so to permit yourself to be imprisoned that every
enemy of yours may take vantage against you.”
They both chose to protect him against the enemies
who certainly were not guileless; and bestowed on
him an affection which was half-admiring and half-pitying;
an affection returned by that which is
often felt by a tender and pliant nature for a rugged
and imperious one. When Cranmer felt impelled
to remonstrate with their proceedings, he did so
with trepidation; they ignored the remonstrances,
but liked him none the worse. It might be said that
he was the only man or woman of whom, being
brought in frequent contact, Henry never fell foul.
There was always warm respect in Henry’s fondness
for him; and Henry was by no means the man to
feel respect for a time-server.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">CRANMER AND SOMERSET</span></h3>

<p>The death of Henry was the beginning of a
new era. Hitherto his personality had completely
dominated the situation; effectively, he had become
the most uncontrolled autocrat in Europe, in spite of a
very careful preservation of traditional forms. But
his successor on the throne was a nine-year-old boy,
and there was no dominating personality to take
the dead king’s place. If Henry’s scheme for the
continuation of the government had been framed
with a view to the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>,
it was a very complete failure.</p>

<p>Superficially, that would seem to have been the
idea. The Council of Executors in whom power was
vested by Henry’s will was a body in which the
progressive and stationary or reactionary parties
were both represented. The strength of the latter,
however, suffered serious detriment in the closing
weeks of Henry’s reign by the downfall of the
Howards: while their ecclesiastical leader, Gardiner,
was excluded from the Council, on which their
principal representative among Churchmen was
Tunstal of Durham, a man as mild as Cranmer
himself. Within a week, the Earl of Hertford, now
become Duke of Somerset, had secured the
Protectorate in his own hands, and it became
immediately and abundantly clear that the whole
effective power was in the hands of the progressive
party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Now at this stage there were not many points of
doctrine on which the leaders of the progressive
party were committed to opinions fundamentally
opposed to those received. Cranmer’s chief allies
had not openly rejected even the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
and certainly did not dispute the Real
Presence: but they definitely favoured the administration
of the cup to the laity; they held that it
was lawful for priests to marry; and that auricular
confession was not enjoined by Scripture. Cranmer
had defended each of these views at the time of the
Six Articles and of the King’s Book. They had been
unsatisfied by the removal of “abused images” in
the last reign, and desired an extension thereof.
Cranmer’s own exposition of what he considered
orthodox doctrine was contained in the Book of
Homilies which he had prepared but had failed to
persuade Henry to authorise: while the idea of a
new uniform Book of Services had long been familiar
and vaguely in favour. The men of the “Old Learning”
did not fear the specific innovations as particularly
dangerous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>; what they did fear was
that the innovators would go a great deal further.</p>

<p>We remark, then, first, that under the <i>régime</i> of
Somerset, the changes in religion were almost precisely
what the Archbishop had advocated under
Henry VIII. The Homilies were authorised; the
destruction of “abused images” was renewed; the
administration of the cup to the laity in the sacrament
was enjoined, and the marriage of priests permitted&mdash;both
on the petition of convocation; and the
promulgation of a new Order of Service was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
of necessity attended by an “Act of Uniformity” compelling
the clergy to adopt it. Equally as a matter
of course, the Six Articles Act, against which Cranmer
had fought at the outset, was repealed. The present
writer has in the past been severely rebuked for attributing
the form the Reformed Church in England
took to Cranmer more than to any other single man.
“He ought to know,” said the critics, “that Somerset
was the man.” Yet repentance lags. Somerset was
the politician who, up to a certain point, carried
the Reformation through: at that point his influence
on it ceased abruptly, and the business passed into
Warwick’s hands. The point where this change took
place coincided accurately with the completion of the
series of reforms of which the Archbishop had for
some years past avowedly been in favour. The
inference that Somerset was guided by Cranmer is
sufficiently obvious, though no doubt the hand was
the Protector’s hand. The further advance after
Somerset’s fall was mainly, or largely, the work of
men of extreme views, whose zeal the Archbishop succeeded,
to some extent, in restraining; his influence
was still at work&mdash;no longer, however, as that of the
artificer, but as that of the moderator.</p>

<p>Apparently, Cranmer and the Protector worked
in complete harmony, save in the one matter of the
chantries; but there is no sign at all that he took
his cue from the Protector. The principles of
Somerset’s reformation were his. Those principles,
moreover, do not appear to have gone beyond
what the most anti-Protestant of modern Anglicans
accept. The statutory changes, however, were accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
by proceedings of a regrettable character.
In the attack on images, individuals were guilty of
violence and irreverence, not to say sacrilege.
Extravagant and inflammatory language was used
in the pulpits. The treatment of the leaders of the
Opposition was not altogether free from vindictiveness.
For the first group, Cranmer was in no way
responsible; Somerset was, because in some respects
he set a bad example himself. For the second, the
two were jointly responsible, since preaching was
restricted to licensed persons, and the licences were
issued only by the Protector and the Archbishop.
For the third, Somerset was guiltless. The attacks
on Gardiner and Bonner were made in his absence
and supported by his colleague. But the mildest of
men do not often view opportunities of retaliation
with entire indifference. Gardiner had certainly done
his best to ruin Cranmer under Henry; and by
comparison at least the measures taken against him
were mild enough.</p>

<p>Some consideration, however, must be given to
the argument that the Protector’s government forced
Protestantism hastily and prematurely on a reluctant
nation. Whether the religion formulated in the
first Prayer Book of Edward VI. can be legitimately
called Protestantism at all may be left to the controversialists;
but there is no manner of doubt that
the methods attending the introduction of the
Service Book were ill-judged and vexatious. On the
other hand, the evidence that there was any strong
opposition to the change itself lies mainly in the fact
that the Western rising which immediately followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
was professedly directed against it. Nevertheless,
the mere fact that there was an almost simultaneous
rising in the Eastern counties, which beyond all
question was exclusively agrarian in character,
suggests forcibly that the real moving force of the
Western revolt also was agrarian. Ket’s supporters,
significantly enough, held daily services, using the
new Service Book: while one of the demands of the
Cornishmen was for the restoration of the monastic
lands&mdash;that is, of the monasteries as landlords
in place of their rapacious supplanters. Clerical
agitators would have found little difficulty in making
the Westland rustics believe that half their troubles
were due to the attacks on the Church in the past
reign; and the identification of greedy landlords
with the cause of ecclesiastical reform was at the
worst colourable. Cranmer might condemn and
Latimer might lash the landlords from the pulpit,
Somerset might set up his Court of Requests;
these things did not reach the remote districts.
But there, men did see the spoilers of the Church
enclosing commons, changing tillage into sheep-runs,
and evicting small tenants. And they drew their
conclusions. The Reformation would have had to
wait half a century if it had been delayed till that
argument was deprived of all force. But it may
certainly be granted that the changes which preceded
Somerset’s fall went quite as far as the country
at large was prepared for.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to observe that Cranmer
fairly lost his temper over the Cornish rebellion, and
scolded the insurgents somewhat after the model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
set by Henry VIII. when he rated the Lincolnshire
men a dozen years earlier.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FLOWING TIDE OF PROTESTANTISM</span></h3>

<p>Cranmer had no hand at all in the intrigue which
overthrew the Protector. For a brief interval there
was even some uncertainty whether the group who
had captured the Government might not make terms
with the Opposition, release Gardiner, and possibly
take him into partnership. If Warwick ever had
such an idea in his mind, he was far too acute to
entertain it for long. Gardiner as a colleague would
have been a very dangerous rival. The alternative
was to assume the lead of the advanced wing of the
progressive party. Warwick, who died professing
himself a devout Catholic, had no difficulty in assimilating
the jargon of the zealots, and convincing their
honest enthusiasm that they might look upon him
as a Joshua, while he doubled the part with that of
Achan. To him, religion was not among the things
that mattered; but religion might be made to serve
its turn in forwarding his own ambitions.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Reformation in England had moved
a good deal more closely along the lines laid down
a hundred and fifty years before by Wiclif than on
those of Luther or of Calvin; approximating more
nearly to the Zurich school, though by no means
identical with them. Zurich had proved more attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to English refugees also. But now the abolition
of the penal laws in England, and the dissatisfaction
caused by the Augsburg Interim in Germany, brought
into the country a number of foreigners, Lutheran
and Calvinist as well as Zwinglian, including on
the one hand Bucer and on the other John Knox&mdash;besides
returning English refugees. Not a few of
these foreign visitors were inspired with a lively
missionary zeal, and the freedom of discussion permitted
naturally caused debate and controversy to
wax fast and furious. If the country in general
found the concessions already made to the new
learning somewhat larger than was quite to its taste,
the followers of the new learning were very far from
satisfied with them. And they were vocal exceedingly,
if not precisely harmonious. It was very
soon evident that the comprehensive ambiguity of
the new Book of Common Prayer was in the eyes of
the Reformers too liberal to the old Catholics and
not sufficiently advanced for the new Protestants&mdash;controversy
raging chiefly over two subjects, the
first being the Eucharist, and the second Forms and
Ceremonies.</p>

<p>Without attempting to examine the actual views
on the former subject held at this time by Cranmer&mdash;as
to which critics appear able to form very positive
but very contradictory conclusions&mdash;it may be quite
safely asserted that he had quite definitely given up
all belief in Transubstantiation, but had not accepted
the view most remote from it, that the service was
purely commemorative. The varied range of intermediate
views might be associated with either of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
in a common Form of Service, but these extremes
were evidently incompatible. One or other must
be excluded. Cranmer, his right-hand man Ridley,
and their associates, were all travelling towards the
Zwinglian position, whether they ultimately reached
it or not. If there was to be any more defining, it
was the followers of the old learning who would be
shut out thereby.</p>

<p>It was much the same with forms and ceremonies.
The extreme men, whether they looked to Zurich or
Geneva for guidance, regarded nearly everything in
the way of vestments and ceremonial as the trappings
of the Scarlet Woman. The Archbishop did not.
Where these things did not directly imply the truth
of specific doctrines definitely discarded&mdash;the sacrifice
of the Mass, the worship of images, and the like&mdash;their
preservation, in his view, tended to decency
and reverence. Here, again, it was evident that any
changes must tend to the exclusion of the rigid
Catholics. They and the Calvinists could not travel
in the same boat.</p>

<p>The result is to be seen in the second Prayer Book
of Edward VI., in the new Ordinal, and in the Forty-two
Articles which, with slight modification, became
the Thirty-nine of Queen Elizabeth. Warwick&mdash;otherwise
Northumberland&mdash;was with the extremists,
who were vigorous and loud-voiced, and altogether
exercised an amount of forcing-power quite disproportionate
to the number of their adherents
among the general public. If they had had
their way, the re-modelling would have been on
lines satisfactory to John Knox. Northumberland’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
government would not have stood in the way. The
Lutheranism of Germany and the Augsburg Confession
was uncongenial. It was Cranmer, Ridley,
and their adherents who succeeded in retaining
for the Church of England a form to which she could
mould herself, after the Marian <i>régime</i>, without returning
to the Roman obedience or adopting the
Scottish model. If that was a praiseworthy achievement,
it is to Cranmer primarily that the praise is
rightfully due.</p>

<p>That is what Cranmer did. From Somerset’s
record, it may reasonably be inferred that it is very
much what he would have endeavoured to do if he
had remained in power. But he did not have the
opportunity, because he was not in power, and
Warwick cut his head off.</p>

<p>What Cranmer would have liked to do, beyond
what he did, is another matter, and may be gathered
from his proposed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum</i>&mdash;a
document which shows that, Erastian
though he was, he desired the clergy to have much
ampler powers of jurisdiction than there was the
faintest chance of the State delegating to them. It
was an essay in constitution-making of a decidedly
academic order: the machinery would never have
worked. It does not reveal unsuspected qualities
of constructive statesmanship; but it does not
detract from the credit due to the manner in which
the Archbishop managed to steer the ship through
very stormy waters with a mutinous crew on board.
The performance was not, perhaps, masterly; but
it is not extravagant praise to call it meritorious.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">DE PROFUNDIS</span></h3>

<p>Northumberland’s methods did not make him
popular; but they made him powerful, and it was
his primary object to place on the throne in succession
to Edward some one who should be his own
puppet. To this end he devoted himself in the last
months of the young king’s life. By Henry VIII.’s
will, the succession was fixed first on Mary, then on
Elizabeth, then on the Greys&mdash;not Suffolk himself,
but his wife Frances Brandon and their children.
The accession of Mary could only mean destruction
for Northumberland. He could not be sure of
Elizabeth, who was now in her twentieth year. But
he thought he could make quite sure of Lady Jane
Grey, who was hardly more than a child and had
been brought up under pronounced Protestant
tutelage. His plan was to marry her to one of his
own sons, induce Edward to assume the authority
formally granted to his father and name her his
heir&mdash;ostensibly, of course, on the ground that both
his sisters had been declared illegitimate and those
judgments had not been revoked&mdash;and trust to
intrigue and force to secure her on the throne.
Having won the king over, he succeeded in entangling
several of the Council in the conspiracy; the
rest were then worked upon individually to give
their adherence. One after another did so, reluctantly,
till all were drawn in save Hales&mdash;Cranmer
being the last, and assenting only on the positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
assurance that the Crown lawyers had guaranteed
the constitutional validity of the instrument he was
called upon to sign, and under direct personal
pressure from the king. Northumberland, however,
had completely miscalculated the forces at work.
He knew that the very signatories of the document
could not be relied on when out of his reach; but
having them under his grip, he thought himself safe.
But the country rallied to Mary; the troops deserted
to her standard; the plot failed, ignominiously and
utterly. Mary was hailed Queen; the arch-traitor
was sent to the block; for the rest, only a few of
those most conspicuously compromised were sent to
the Tower.</p>

<p>It was, of course, obvious at the outset that Mary’s
rule must mean the return to power of the party
which had been in opposition under Somerset and
more actively repressed under his successor. The
daughter of Katharine of Aragon was a convinced
adherent of the entire Roman position. That she
would go so far as to restore the Roman obedience
might have been a matter of doubt; but, short of
that, she was not likely to allow limits to reaction.
Gardiner and Bonner, Tunstal and Day and Heath,
had all been imprisoned and deprived of their sees
during the last four years; it was not likely that
the advanced bishops would be allowed to retain
their functions. And, beyond theological differences,
some of them had been driven by the religious motive
into open and vigorous support of Lady Jane Grey’s
succession. Of Cranmer himself the most that could
be said was that he was an assenting party; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Ridley, Bishop of London, had committed himself
to the cause in somewhat inflammatory language.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mary was in no haste to strike.
Every one who feared for his own skin was given
time and opportunity to retire from the country&mdash;whereof
not a few made haste to take advantage.
Ridley was arrested; but Cranmer, Latimer, and
others who stood their ground manfully, might have
gone if they would. After all, no Catholics during
the last reign had suffered anything worse than
imprisonment, and Mary’s leniency towards the
participators in the rebellion may well have given
an impression that retaliation would not go beyond
the infliction of corresponding penalties.</p>

<p>Cranmer, then, remained at large for a time. But
a report was circulated that he was about to make
submission, and had himself set up the Mass again.
Had it not been for this, he might have hoped to be
allowed to retire into obscurity; but the rumour
stirred him to an indignant and uncompromising
denial, which was promptly followed by his arrest
for complicity in Northumberland’s plot. The
Archbishop was by nature a sanguine man, but he
can hardly have imagined that this protest of his
would be allowed to pass; for it was practically a
challenge to all and sundry who desired the Mass to
be restored. No government of the time would
have dreamed of ignoring the action of its author.</p>

<p>Even when he was safely in the Tower along with
Ridley, the hopefulness of Cranmer’s temperament
displayed itself. He had an incurable conviction
that any one who listened to him was bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
recognise the entire reasonableness of his views;
and from prison he petitioned Mary for leave to
“open his mind” to her. That accomplished, he
felt that he would have discharged his conscience
and could retire from further controversy without
reproach, even though he might fail to persuade his
sovereign. The duty of conformity, in conduct at
least, to the sovereign’s decrees, was, as already
remarked, a cardinal belief with him.</p>

<p>The petition was not granted. Moreover, the
reign of clemency was destined to very brief duration.
Wyatt’s rebellion hardened the Queen, whose determination
to marry Philip of Spain strengthened <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari
passu</i> with her determination to be reconciled with
Rome and to discharge her duty as a daughter of
the Church by bringing her subjects back to the
fold. Throughout 1554 signs accumulated, ominous
of the coming storm. Whatever Mary’s original
intent may have been, mercy to Cranmer must have
ceased to be a part of it at an early stage; though,
if she had definitely resolved on his destruction, it is
difficult to find an adequate explanation of the
extreme prolongation of his imprisonment.</p>

<p>In April 1554, the three who were most obnoxious
to Mary and the reactionaries, Cranmer, Ridley,
and Latimer, were removed to Oxford, to play their
part in a great disputation. All three held their
ground stoutly. It was pronounced, of course, that
all three had been completely refuted, and were
manifest heretics; but being thereupon invited to
recant, they all refused. Cranmer had been treated
with considerable rudeness in the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
debates; but the mildness and dignity of his bearing
throughout were such that one of his chief
antagonists, the Prolocutor, Dean Weston, thanked
him openly for his admirable behaviour.</p>

<p>This condemnation, however, was of no practical
account, since, in 1554, the penal laws against
heresy were not yet re-enacted. On the other hand,
to punish Cranmer for treason would be a palpable
piece of pure vindictiveness. His treason, such as it
was, had been shared by several of the men who were
now on the Council. But the arrival of Pole and
the formal reconciliation with Rome at the close of
the year were accompanied by the revival of the
statute <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de heretico comburendo</i>, and the great persecution
opened in February with the burning of
Rogers. A twelvemonth more passed before the
end came for Cranmer himself. It is perhaps, after
all, a sufficient explanation of the delay that the
Primate of England could only be condemned for
heresy by the Pope. Other cases fell within the
jurisdiction of the legatine or national ecclesiastical
courts; his did not.</p>

<p>In September 1555, a Papal Commission sat in
Oxford to examine the case of the Archbishop and
report to Rome for the Pope to pass judgment.
Cranmer refused to recognise the jurisdiction, but
made a declaration in answer to the questions put
to him as coming from the Queen’s Proctors, who
were on the Commission. He maintained his views on
the Sacrament, and on the Royal Supremacy, and on
the usurpations of Rome; and justified his actions on
all points in respect of which it had been impugned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
The trial over, he followed up his defence by a
vigorous address to the Queen, asserting the utter
incompatibility of any sovereign authority with the
Papal claims. On November 25 the Pope pronounced
his excommunication. In the meantime
Ridley and Latimer had been condemned by a court
under the authority of the Legate, Cardinal Pole,
on October 1, and on the 16th they suffered
martyrdom&mdash;Cranmer, it is said, witnessing the
scene from the roof of his prison.</p>

<p>Cranmer remained in prison, cut off from every
sympathiser. It is easy to forget, but it should not
be difficult to realise, the tremendous strain on a
nature like his&mdash;sensitive, diffident, imaginative.
All his life he had been surrounded and supported
by the personal affection of friends. Now, every
conceivable incentive to doubt whether he had been
in the right after all was set to work on him simultaneously.
Yet month followed month, and he
remained steadfast&mdash;unless his expression of a desire
to confer with Tunstal or Pole was a sign of weakening.
Before he could be handed over to the secular
arm, his ecclesiastical degradation was necessary.
The sentence was carried out with every circumstance
of public ignominy&mdash;Bonner, the principal performer,
excelling himself in his coarse brutality. For a man
with highstrung nerves, the thing must have been
simply shattering.</p>

<p>At the ceremony (February 14) he had drawn from
his sleeve an appeal from the Pope to a general council;
and about this time he signed in close succession
what are called four recantations. Two of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
probably preceded the degradation; the other two
Bonner extracted from him on February 15. None
of them are recantations at all. They are submissions
to the authority of the sovereign, to whom he had
always taught that submission is due. He had
obeyed his own conscience in contravention of his
own theory hitherto; now, he returned to the theory,
and owned that if the secular sovereign willed to
establish Papal authority, obedience was still due.
As to doctrine he recanted nothing. But this was
not nearly enough for Mary and Pole, who were bent
on extracting something which should altogether
discredit the cause of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Within ten days the writ for his burning was issued.
Then, before three more weeks had passed Cranmer
broke down under the strain, writing first a full and
complete recantation of every impugned doctrine,
and then one more&mdash;dictated to him (March 18).
No man ever repudiated his whole past in terms
more ignominious. His enemies had what they
wanted; if they had stopped there and pardoned
him, the force of the blow would have been incalculable.
But their thirst for his blood gave him the
chance of salvation, changing their victory to hopeless
rout. They did not pardon. They demanded
from the victim the public confirmation from his
own lips of the recantations he had written and
signed. That one disastrous moment of weakness
was to be gloriously redeemed.</p>

<p>Three days after his fall, on a morning of foul
March weather, Cranmer was conveyed from his
prison to listen himself to his own funeral discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and then to play his own allotted part. No suspicion
seems to have crossed the mind of his gaolers
that there was anything for them to fear. The
oration over&mdash;he had listened with frequent tears&mdash;he
was bidden to make public avowal of his recantation.
He arose; he confessed the grievousness of
his sin, entreating pardon before the Throne of
Omnipotence. And then he declared the nature of
his sin. Before those about him could realise what
was happening, he had recanted his recantation,
declaring the truth of all he had before upheld, and
proclaiming, “As my hand offended in writing contrary
to my heart, therefore my hand shall first be
punished. For if I may come to the fire, it shall first
be burned.” Hastily he was silenced, and hurried
to the stake; but of his own will he moved so
swiftly that the confessors could scarce keep pace
with him. And when, indeed, he “came to the fire”
he fulfilled his words. Men saw him thrust the
offending right hand into the flame, and hold it
there till it was consumed.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So tragically, so triumphantly, closed the drama
of Cranmer’s life&mdash;surely a close fitted for “purging
the passions through pity and fear.” A vase of fine
porcelain whirled into the eddies in company with
pots of brass and stoneware; a scholar, dragged
from academic cloisters to control a revolution; a
man with a receptive mind, when receptivity was
about as dangerous a quality, for himself, as he could
possess. A man whom men have ventured to call
craven, yet who alone of his contemporaries dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
to remonstrate with Cromwell in his policy and
with the eighth Henry in the day of his wrath, and
that not once, nor twice. A man who endured till
the eleventh hour, and then&mdash;fell.</p>

<p>But a man who, ere the twelfth hour had struck,
rose up the Victor.</p>

<h2 id="WILLIAM_CECIL">WILLIAM CECIL, LORD BURGHLEY</h2>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MINISTERS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH</span></h3>

<p>William Cecil was born in 1520. He lived to the
age of seventy-eight, dying in the same year as
Philip II. of Spain, who was five years his junior.
His political connexion began before Henry VIII.
was in his grave; and for more than fifty years it
continued, except for his retirement from the public
eye during the complete period of the Marian persecution.
Even in his old age, when his son Robert
was already becoming, in his own crafty fashion,
the most important person in Queen Elizabeth’s
Council, the father was still the adviser on whom
she leaned in the last resort. For forty years he was,
in fact, the mainstay of her Government. For
twenty of those years&mdash;roughly from 1569 to 1589&mdash;a
man of even higher ability, in some respects, than
himself, Francis Walsingham, was his loyal colleague.
They served the cleverest, the most successful, and
the most exasperating princess who ever sat upon a
throne. Both of them&mdash;especially Walsingham&mdash;told
her home-truths on occasion; both of them&mdash;especially
Walsingham&mdash;she on occasion abused like
a Billingsgate fish-wife. But all three were unfailingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
loyal to each other; and among them they
raised England to the forefront of the nations of
Christendom.</p>

<div id="ip_280" class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;"><img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="486" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p><i>WILLIAM CECIL (LORD BURGHLEY)</i></p>

<p><i>From a Portrait by</i> <span class="smcap">Marc Gheeraedts</span> (?) <i>in the National
Portrait Gallery</i></p></div></div>

<p>To establish orderly government at home, to settle
a religious <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus vivendi</i>, to avoid war, and to
prevent the succession of Mary Stewart or any pronounced
Catholic&mdash;these were the main aims on
which Elizabeth and her two great ministers were
united. Of the three, Walsingham&mdash;a Puritan&mdash;was
the least devoted to the Peace policy, Elizabeth
the most determined on that policy; yet it was
Elizabeth who habitually endangered it. The Queen’s
tortuous methods, pursued in defiance of her counsellors,
more than once seemed to have brought her
to a point where war was inevitable; yet time after
time her ingenuity, or her lucky star, or a return
just in time to Cecil’s guidance, saved the situation.
Never has a sovereign been better served; never has
there been a reign in which rulers and ruled worked
in more essential concord. Idealism and common
sense were united in the conduct of affairs with a
completeness which has rarely, if ever, been paralleled&mdash;never
have the toils of the men of counsel and the
men of action been more effectively combined. And
England was peculiarly fortunate in this&mdash;that the
great antagonist whom finally she fought and overthrew
could be thoroughly relied on always to miss the
opportunity for which he was always waiting, always
to move only when the moment had passed irrevocably.
So England was the victor in the great duel;
and the Stewarts found her might established on a
basis so firm that even they were unable to pull it down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
That result was not due to any one mind&mdash;to any
single guide. Elizabeth, her ministers, her seamen,
and her people, all contributed their share; and the
work was crowned by the glory of her poets. Burghley
may not have been personally a statesman of the
highest rank, though if he is not included in that
category it is a little difficult to name any Englishman
who is entitled to that honour. There is a certain
commonplace, <i>bourgeois</i> touch about him; he stands
for the common sense, not the idealist, side, in the
combination which made England great. His virtues
were those of the successful pursuers of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">via
media</i>. He did not organise revolution: he did not
dream of an empire on which the sun should never
set. But he played the political game with unfailing
loyalty to his sovereign and his country, with level-headed
shrewdness, with imperturbable resolution.
There are few men to whom England owes so much;
and if there be those to whom she owes more, their
deeds but for him would yet have been impossible.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">CECIL UNDER EDWARD VI. AND MARY</span></h3>

<p>In the reign of Henry VII., Richard Sitsilt, affirmed
by tradition to be of an ancient Welsh family long
established among the gentry of the Marches, owned
broad acres in the counties of Monmouth and Herefordshire.
One of his sons, David, who elected to
modify his name into Cecil, transferred himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Lincolnshire, where he prospered greatly. He and
his son Richard became very large landed proprietors,
and held a variety of offices connected with the
Court under Henry VIII. So it would appear that
the present Marquess of Salisbury is not unconnected
by descent with the “Celtic fringe.” It must be
admitted, however, that the notable qualities of his
great ancestor are not those usually associated with
what is supposed to be the Celtic temperament. Still
in that connexion a rather curious point may be
touched on. A critic has recently remarked that
there is a type of statesmanship which we are in the
habit of regarding as peculiarly English (<i>à propos</i> of
l’Hôpital), naming in a brief list both Burghley and
Cromwell&mdash;Oliver, apparently, not Thomas. Now
Oliver was descended from the sister of Thomas,
whose husband was a Welshman, and whose son
chose to adopt the maternal patronymic instead of
his father’s name, which was Williams. So Wales
has some title to claim the Tudors, the Cecils,
and the great Oliver among her contributions to
“English” celebrities.</p>

<p>William Cecil was born in 1520, and when in due
course he went to Cambridge, he became a member of
a distinguished group of scholars which included
Roger Ascham, afterwards tutor of Lady Jane Grey
and of Elizabeth; John Cheke, who became the
tutor of Edward VI., and whose sister was Cecil’s
first wife; and Nicholas Bacon, who married the
sister of Cecil’s second wife. William Cecil married
Mary Cheke in 1541: she died in less than two years,
after bearing him one son, Thomas, afterwards Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Exeter. Nearly three years later he married Mildred,
daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, the “governor” of
Prince Edward&mdash;a young lady of portentous learning,
whose name Roger Ascham coupled with that of
Jane Grey. Thus Cecil himself was not only well
versed in the most progressive learning of his time,
but his chosen associates, including both the first
and the second wife, were all distinguished for
erudition&mdash;and all, it may be remarked, tinged with
the “New Learning” in the specific ecclesiastical
sense of the term.</p>

<p>Before the death of Henry VIII. the young man
was already the recipient of Court favour, and in the
good graces of the Earl of Hertford, to whose personal
service we find him definitely attached in the early
days of the Protectorship. He accompanied the
Protector on his Scottish invasion, was present at
Pinkie, and was made Somerset’s secretary about a
year later. His assiduity and his immense capacity
for mastering laborious detail must have been of
infinite value to his chief, whose woeful lack of
practicality must, on the other hand, have intensified
his secretary’s inborn tendency to rate common sense
in method a long way higher than visionary idealism
of aim. All his life long, nothing ever induced Cecil
to deviate from safe precedent and respectable
courses&mdash;bold enough, when his foresight satisfied
him that boldness was the better part of prudence,
but never rash. Every step was always carefully
calculated, and a path for retreat kept open if there
was the remotest risk of retreat being necessary. In
the service of the most impulsive and sentimental of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
statesmen, he learnt&mdash;if he needed to learn&mdash;never
to act upon sentiment or impulse.</p>

<p>When Somerset fell in 1549 Cecil was still some
way short of thirty; but he had an old head on his
young shoulders&mdash;and he had every intention of
keeping it there. He had no personal devotion to
Somerset or to his policy, and had carefully avoided
quarrelling with anybody. When he perceived that
the ship was scuttled, he had no compunction about
making sure of leaving it in a decent and orderly
manner before it sank. He did not quite desert;
he remained with the Protector in the discharge of
his duties, while very nearly every one else was
making a parade of sympathy with the cabal who
obviously held the winning cards; but he remained
there in careful obscurity&mdash;the personal secretary,
not the partisan. He did not escape a brief imprisonment
in the Tower; no doubt he had counted
on that. But Warwick was perfectly aware of his
power of making himself useful, and saw no possible
reason why he should not avail himself thereof&mdash;nor
did Cecil. Competent officials were few, and of
these some had already put themselves out of court,
in Warwick’s eyes, either by having supported
Somerset too boldly or by displaying doubtful
religious leanings. The former secretary of Somerset
had not made himself obnoxious in any quarter;
and in the following September (1550) he emerged
again into public life in a more responsible position
than before, as Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The political waters were, to say the least, unquiet;
there was no telling when squalls might be coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Personal intrigues were rife. Cecil had no ambition
to grasp the tiller under these conditions. He was
ready to give advice to the best of his ability; he
was ready to carry out instructions, whether they
accorded with his advice or not; but he was not
disposed to give orders on his own account&mdash;his
ambition was not of the vaulting sort. His business
was to keep his own footing, whether others did so or
no; he would take no risks unless his own life were
endangered by refusing them&mdash;every man must take
care of himself. If Warwick chose to insist on a
policy which the secretary disapproved&mdash;alliance with
France abroad, or debasement of coinage at home&mdash;that
was Warwick’s business, not the secretary’s:
what he had to do was to carry out the policy imposed
on him, with the maximum of efficiency and
the minimum of friction, without allowing himself
to be identified with the policy or with antagonism
to it.</p>

<p>So when Warwick made up his mind that Somerset
must be finally removed, it was Cecil’s cue to avoid,
so far as he could, taking an active part in so ungracious
a business as his old patron’s destruction&mdash;but
certainly not to invite destruction for himself by
injudicious partisanship. He did not scruple even
to give Warwick information injurious to Somerset;
though it was probably only because he knew it
would reach that cunning schemer’s ears sooner or
later&mdash;and when it came to a choice between profiting
or suffering by the inevitable, he had no qualms about
profiting. Still, he managed to be too much occupied
with foreign negotiations to have much to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the Somerset affair. As for the foreign negotiations
themselves, he did not make any attempt to counteract
the policy which, against his own judgment, he
was called upon to carry out, but he was very
seriously and not unsuccessfully engaged in minimising
the untoward consequences which he foresaw.</p>

<p>As the young king’s death drew manifestly near,
the intrigues of Northumberland, as Warwick had
now become, thickened. Sir William&mdash;he had been
knighted at the end of 1551&mdash;did not like intrigues;
but in spite of seasonable illness, which may have
been genuine, he could not altogether avoid being
dragged in, and was obliged&mdash;like all the rest of the
Council&mdash;to append his signature to the document
nominating Lady Jane Grey heir to the throne. He
averred afterwards that he signed only as a witness&mdash;a
statement more ingenious than ingenuous. Still,
he took care that there should be evidence from
unofficial quarters that he would have avoided
signing if he could, and that so far as he was formally
a participator in Northumberland’s plot it was with
no goodwill to its success&mdash;which, indeed, was the
attitude of several other signatories, who did their
best to upset the scheme the moment they felt safe
in doing so. Cranmer, however, the most reluctant
of any of them, had no such double-dealing in his
mind, and made no attempt to evade the responsibility
when he had once assumed it, though he
had been tricked into acquiescence by a lie.</p>

<p>It is only fair, in judging Cecil’s conduct through
these years, to remember that he was only in his
twenty-seventh year when Somerset became Protector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and in his thirty-third year when Queen Mary
succeeded. Warwick made him Secretary of State
eight days before his thirtieth birthday. Of course,
if the errors he committed had been errors of youth,
he would have won easy forgiveness; yet in some
respects his excessive caution may reasonably be
attributed to his youth. He had every excuse for
arguing that a real control must be out of his reach
for many years, and that till it came within his reach
he was not called upon to insist on his own views. In
those days the servants of the State did not resign&mdash;the
remark has been made before&mdash;they carried out
the policy imposed on them from above. He was
content, therefore, to bide his time, and for the
present to do the political drudgery for Somerset
or Northumberland, while he avoided committing
himself personally to anybody or anything. This
course was not one which permitted the exercise of
generosity or magnanimity; it completely eschewed
the idea of self-sacrifice; but it was a course which
he could and did pursue without ever fairly laying
himself open to the charge of treachery, or incurring
the faintest suspicion of what is called corruption.
If he was guided by considerations of personal advantage,
it was not in the sense that any one could
bid successfully for his support.</p>

<p>So when Northumberland’s plot collapsed ignominiously,
Cecil, although a Protestant and officially
opposed to Gardiner, had no difficulty in making his
peace with the new Government. Only, the political
seas being stormier than ever, he had no inclination
either to head an Opposition or to take a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
place among the queen’s ministers. He was too
much of a Protestant for that, though not too much
so to conform and “bow himself in the House of
Rimmon.” In short, he courted an obscurity from
which the Government had no desire to extract him&mdash;though
it is probable that if he had chosen to offer
himself as an instrument for Mary’s use, she would
have availed herself of him readily enough. But it
was one thing to pass from Somerset’s employ to
Warwick’s, and another to pass from Northumberland’s
to Mary’s. Besides, by keeping in the
background now he could quietly establish himself
in the confidence of the probable successor to the
throne, the Princess Elizabeth. Being a member of
the Parliament of 1556, he therein openly opposed
sundry Government measures which were hotly
resisted by the House of Commons, but even then
he behaved with circumspection and did not suffer
for his conduct. His real business was with Elizabeth;
and when the crisis came, and Mary died, the members
of the Council who hastened to Hatfield found Cecil
already installed as her Prime Minister elect, with the
scheme for carrying on the Government completely
organised.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT ELIZABETH’S ACCESSION</span></h3>

<p>Sir William had bided his time, and that time had
arrived. On the throne was a young woman of five-and-twenty,
who had already shown a skill akin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Cecil’s own in the avoidance of fatally compromising
words or acts under circumstances when the utmost
wariness had been the constant condition of safety.
She had maintained her Protestantism in precisely
the same way and in very much the same degree as
he had done; moreover, she was bound for her own
sake to maintain it, since her personal claim to
legitimate birth was bound up with the rejection of
Papal authority. Cecil had received her confidence,
it may be, in part, because she was aware that she
could afford to indulge her own waywardness more
freely while she had so eminently safe a counsellor
as a stand-by. He, for his part, was doubtless fully
satisfied that she had intelligence enough to recognise
that he was indispensable to her, and that in the
main their views of policy would harmonise. The
young man had held aloof from intrigues and had
declined all temptations to grasp at dangerous power,
not from lack of ambition or of patriotism, but
because the power would have been too dearly bought
and its foundations too unstable. Now, while he
was still in the prime of life, yet of ripe experience,
power lay ready for him to grasp&mdash;power to guide
England in the courses which he believed would
serve her best interests; power to cure the evils
from which she had been suffering for many a year
past; power to avert those which menaced her in
the future; power which, once achieved, he was not
likely to lose unless by his own blundering. He
knew his own capacity. To refuse power under
such conditions would have been not caution but
pusillanimity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
It may be that the account of Cecil’s public life
during the reigns of Edward and Mary gives an
impression merely that he was an exceedingly
astute young man with no principles to speak of.
If so, that view must be corrected. He valued
himself on his own complete integrity, and would
have done nothing which he recognised as inconsistent
therewith. He had principles, but not
enthusiasms. In politics, as in religion, he had
his own opinions, but in both he admitted a very
large body of <i>adiaphora</i>, things which were not
questions of principle, though regarded as such
by persons afflicted with enthusiasms. On all
such matters, passive or even active conformity
to the policy of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> rulers was permissible.
He was ready to go to Mass, but not to take a part
in the suppression of Protestantism. He would
assent to Northumberland’s plot, but he would
not further it. His integrity drew a line&mdash;lower
than a person of finer moral susceptibilities would
have drawn it, but with sufficient firmness and
decision, and higher than most of his more prominent
contemporaries. He did not feel called upon
to swim against a stream which would overwhelm
him if he did so; but he made for a backwater.
It is often difficult to judge when and where courage
becomes rashness, and prudence cowardice. On
the whole, he was more inclined to be too prudent
than too bold; but it was not because he lacked
courage. His conduct might on occasion, though
rarely, be charged as disloyal; it could never
fairly be called treacherous. He was convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
that as a general rule honesty is the best policy,
and justice is the best policy; but in the exceptional
cases where he thought they were not, he
chose&mdash;the best policy. The principles of his mistress
were the same; but she deviated from the mean of
resolute caution more markedly and more erratically
than her minister; she was more readily rash
and more easily frightened; her criterion of justice
was lax, and her sense of honesty very nearly non-existent.</p>

<p>There was this very important difference between
the state of affairs on Queen Elizabeth’s accession
and their position between 1546 and 1558. Hitherto
a statesman, even if perfectly secure of power,
would still have had a difficult course to steer;
but security being wanting, the lack of it was the
gravest of all the difficulties. The course of safety
now was not less intricate; but, in spite of appearances,
there was no longer the same risk of incalculable
irregular forces wrecking the ship. To retain
a useful illustration or analogy; it was one thing to
be responsible for bringing the ship home “through
billows and through gales,” and another to carry
her through a narrow and devious channel infested
with reefs and sandbanks, in fair weather. The
pilot who judged that he knew every inch of the
reefs and sandbanks might feel that the business
was an anxious one; to the less discerning passenger,
he would often seem to be heading his vessel
straight for the rocks; but the pilot himself would
not feel any fear of finding himself helpless.
As long as he made no mistakes he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
safe; and if he made mistakes, it would be his own
fault.</p>

<p>After the event, when the developments of a
particular situation have taken place, it is always
difficult to realise the aspect the situation itself
presented to the statesman who had to deal with
it. Still, the attempt has to be made.</p>

<p>Almost from time immemorial until the reign of
Henry VIII. antagonism between England and
France was traditional; through great part of that
period, alliance between England and the House of
Burgundy had also been traditional, being largely
based on the immense importance of the commercial
intercourse between the Low Countries and England.
During Henry VIII.’s reign, Wolsey and the king
had broken away from the theory of animosity
to France, but neither of them had held the
Burgundian friendship cheap, and popular sentiment
had lost very little of its anti-Gallic flavour. Further,
we are apt not to bear in mind that, for forty years
past, Spain, Burgundy, and the Empire had been
combined under one head; the importance of Burgundy
as a factor in the relations with Charles escapes
our attention. More or less unconsciously, we
think almost exclusively of France and the Empire;
as in the coming period we think almost exclusively
of France and Spain.</p>

<p>Now in 1558 the dominions of Charles V. were
divided between his brother who became Emperor
and his son who was lord of Spain and Burgundy.
Philip, not the Emperor, is the rival of the French
monarchy. The old grounds for seeking friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
with Philip as lord of Burgundy remain. The
new reasons for hostility to Philip as King of Spain
have not yet developed. The reigning Pope had
been elected by French influence. The Council of
Trent had not yet defined permanently the line of
cleavage between so-called Catholics and Protestants;
Philip had not assumed the position of the Church’s
champion and the scourge of heretics; his influence
in England was understood to have been exerted,
so far as it was exercised at all, in mitigation of
persecution.</p>

<p>On the other hand, antagonism between French
and English interests was acute. England, drawn
into a French war in Mary’s reign, had just lost her
last foothold on French soil&mdash;Calais, which she had
held for three hundred years; and though the loss
might not be of great political or strategical consequence,
its importance was magnified by popular
sentiment. But apart from this: the young Queen
of Scots had married the French Dauphin, only
in this same year; and as a mere question of legitimacy,
there was no possible doubt that her title to
the throne of England was very much better than
that of Elizabeth, who had been declared illegitimate
by the English Courts of Justice, which judgment
had never been formally reversed. The natural
outcome of this marriage would be to bind France
and Scotland together in all and more than all
the intimacy of that ancient alliance between them
which for three centuries had been a thorn in the
side of English kings. Beyond that, the future
Queen of France and Scotland would have a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
much more tenable claim to the throne of England
than ever an English king had had to the throne
of France. Moreover, there was a special danger
threatening under the existing circumstances. Mary
was half a Guise by birth; her Guise mother was
now Regent in Scotland; she was almost wholly
Guise by breeding. The presumption was enormous
that the ascendency of that powerful and ambitious
family in France and their influence in Scotland
would become more dominant than ever; the
Guises were strongly anti-English, and it was the
head of that house who had just achieved the
galling triumph at Calais; while the fanatical
Catholics looked to them as their leaders. A
more active animosity, therefore, towards Protestantism
was to be anticipated from France than from
Spain.</p>

<p>The Spanish Minister in England, naturally
enough under these conditions, took it for granted
that the countenance of Philip was what the new
Government would most urgently need&mdash;that he
would merely have to speak and his instructions
would be humbly obeyed. To his extreme astonishment,
he discovered that nothing was further from
Cecil’s mind. Cecil and his mistress signified quite
clearly that they would judge for themselves whether
they would take his advice or not. At any rate,
they were going to do a good many things entirely
regardless of their being in flat opposition to his
wishes. The Spaniard declared to his master that
Queen and Minister were rushing headlong to destruction;
but they were doing nothing of the kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
What Cecil saw was that Philip could not at any
price afford to withdraw his countenance from
Elizabeth; because the only alternative to Elizabeth
was Mary Stewart, and in that case Mary would unite
the crowns of France, England, and Scotland.
If France moved against England to the danger of
Elizabeth’s throne, Philip would have no choice
but to interfere on behalf of the Queen&mdash;she need
not buy support which he could not afford to withhold.
He might call the tune, but she need not
dance to it unless it suited her.</p>

<p>Within a short period, the French King, Henry II.,
was mortally injured in a tournament. The Dauphin
succeeded, and his wife became Queen of France, as
well as of Scotland. Then the situation was modified
by the death of Francis and the accession of Charles
IX. to the throne, and to power of the Queen-Mother,
Catherine de Medici, and the middle party
who came to be known by the title of the “Politiques.”
With them the Guises were out of favour,
and could no longer count on wielding the power of
France to advance Mary’s interests; yet their
popularity and strength in the country were still
sufficient to keep the chance of their recovering
their ascendency as a menace which Philip could
not disregard. The change, in short, cut both
ways: it was not quite so imperative for Philip
that he should support Elizabeth, but then it was
not so necessary for Elizabeth to have his support.</p>

<p>Thus throughout the first decade of the reign
Cecil calculated with perfect accuracy that Philip
would not attack Elizabeth, whatever she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
do, because he could not risk the accession of Mary
Stewart in her place; and that France would not
make a direct attack, because that would compel
the intervention of Philip. Hence he could go his
own way safely in dealing both with domestic
affairs and with the everlasting problem of Scotland.
There was another matter, that of the Queen’s
marriage, in which Cecil might judge and advise
as he thought fit, but the Queen herself never had
the slightest intention of following any but her own
counsel, or of revealing even to her most trusted
minister what that counsel might really be.</p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">DOMESTIC AND SCOTTISH POLICY</span></h3>

<p>Now, as concerned domestic affairs, two matters
were of first-rate importance. One was religion;
the other finance.</p>

<p>It was evidently quite necessary that a definite
religious settlement should be arrived at, and that
it must be one in which there was a reasonable
prospect of the majority of Englishmen concurring.
There were fervent adherents of the Papacy as restored
by Mary; these were not very numerous.
There were fervent adherents of extreme Swiss
doctrines, Calvinistic or Zwinglian; these were
also few. There were many who, like Gardiner
in early days, had no love for the Papacy, but
clung to traditional doctrines and ritual; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
were not quite so many who might be called perhaps
moderately evangelical; there were a very great
many more who troubled their heads very little
one way or another, and were what we should describe
as High or Low, pretty much according to
their environment. The extreme reformers had
very nearly but not quite succeeded in carrying
the day during Northumberland’s ascendency; the
extreme Catholics had just had their turn under
Mary. The extremists on both sides were intolerant,
and it was quite obvious that the triumph of either
would drive many moderates into joining the other
extreme, and would keep the country in a state of
violent unrest, or, at the best, of sullen submission.
The experiment of trying to maintain traditional
doctrine and ritual with the minimum of modification,
while repudiating the Roman authority, had
been tried under Henry; and it was fairly clear
that a simple return to Henry’s standards was
impracticable. The course which Cecil laid down
was to adopt a compromise in which the great
majority could at any rate acquiesce; a compromise
which, while insisting on conformity, allowed
of a very considerable latitude of interpretation;
which would still pass, in many quarters where it
did not satisfy; which was in short politically
adequate. Cecil himself would probably have had
no quite insuperable objection either to attending
Mass or to sitting at Communion; but a compromise
which allowed of either course would also
probably have found a less general acceptance than
one which excluded both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Hardly less important was the restoration of
financial stability. Twelve years before, King
Henry had left matters in sufficiently ill-plight.
The Government could not, perhaps, be held responsible
for the existence of severe agricultural
depression; but, for its aggravation, the newly
developed class of landlords was largely to blame,
while no one but Somerset had attempted to hold
them in check. In the general ferment, commercial
honesty had been on the downgrade. Among
financial officials, corruption had been rampant;
and Henry set the example of one of the grossest
forms of dishonesty by debasing the coinage, paying
his debts, when he did pay them, in the debased
coin. Hence in commercial circles credit was bad,
while abroad the national credit was exceedingly
low; and the national exchequer was almost
empty. Through the last two reigns, matters had
gone from bad to worse. Cecil took the finances
in hand with solid systematic common sense. A
rigid supervision of expenditure and stoppage of
waste took the place of the prevailing laxity. Men
of probity were employed by the Government as its
financial agents. The debased coins were called in,
and the new currency issued was of a standard
which had never been surpassed. Loans were repaid
with punctuality, and debts discharged. Almost
at once, it followed that fresh loans could be raised
at reasonable rates of interest, instead of at the
ruinous charges which Edward and Mary had to
pay; before long, it was hardly necessary to seek
for them abroad&mdash;the merchants at home were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
ready and willing to come forward. Confidence was
restored under a steady Government.</p>

<p>Cecil’s economy may have verged on parsimony,
and his mistress was as sharp in money matters as
her grandfather; hard things are always said of a
Government which takes Peace and Retrenchment
for its motto. But peace and retrenchment were a
stern necessity, and in many respects the parsimony
has been exaggerated; at any rate, the expenditure
was thoroughly well directed. Later in the reign
it would probably have been sound policy to spend
more, particularly in Ireland, where efficiency was
sacrificed to economy; but outside of Ireland the
nation got good value for every penny of outlay.
In finance, as in other matters, Cecil habitually
followed the maxims of caution. Consistently with
this attitude, we do not find him striking out new
economic theories. He believed, as nearly every
one believed three hundred years ago, that new industries
had very little chance of being established
without the artificial stimulus of monopolies and
patents to prevent competition&mdash;a system which
always appeals most convincingly to the monopolist,
but less convincingly to the consumer and
the would-be competitor, as Elizabeth found before
the end of the reign. Whatever we may think of
the methods adopted to foster and encourage trade
and the development of new industries, Cecil is at
least entitled to full credit for recognising that this
was the direction in which the compensation and
the remedy for agricultural depression were to be
sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
The subject of the secretary’s financial reforms
has carried us on to a general account of principles
which were only gradually illustrated in the progress
of the reign. The third question which engaged his
immediate activities on Elizabeth’s accession was
the policy to be followed in dealing with Scotland.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Scotland was the friend of France
and the enemy of England; from which it followed
in a general way that Scottish malcontents habitually
looked to England for open or secret countenance,
and very commonly got it. To foster divisions in
Scotland was one way of preventing her from becoming
too actively dangerous a neighbour, and the
plan had been very sedulously followed, especially
throughout the reign of Henry VIII. The Scottish
clerics since the days of Bruce had always been
strongly anti-English, a term which was almost
equivalent to Nationalist. Both James and David
Beton had been especially hostile; while, during the
progress of the Reformation, the Cardinal was a
rigorous and cruel persecutor of heresy. Henry,
with all his pride of orthodoxy, had no objection to
heresy in the northern kingdom, where Protestant
and mal-content were nearly synonymous. Had
England devoted her attention simply to giving the
Protestants such support as would have secured
them a predominance conditional on the support
being maintained, diplomacy might have achieved
the union of the crowns by the marriage of King
Edward to his cousin of Scotland; but Henry and
Somerset between them, by the re-assertion of
English sovereignty and by the appeal to arms, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
roused in Protestants as well as Catholics the nationalist
sentiment which would not endure subjection
to England at any price. The child-queen had
been carried off to France and betrothed to the
Dauphin; and in the years that passed before the
actual marriage the Catholics had held the mastery;
Mary of Guise was regent, and her power was maintained
by French support and French troops. Thus
the Scots began to realise that there was a danger,
when their own Queen should be Queen of France
also, that Scotland might become an appendage of
France. Scotland was no more willing to be subject
to France than to be subject to England.</p>

<p>Thus it was again open to Cecil to adopt the policy,
not of exercising a direct English domination, but of
establishing a Protestant domination, which would in
the nature of things be favourable to England and
unfavourable to France&mdash;a policy which fitted in
precisely with that of establishing a comprehensive
Protestantism in England, to which he was committed
on other counts. He could rely, as we have
already noted, on the fact that Philip, however
reluctant, would be compelled to check aggressive
interference on the part of France, if carried beyond
the limit at which England could cope with it
unaided. This, therefore, was the keynote of his
Scottish policy&mdash;to avoid the blunder of seeming
to threaten Scotland’s independence, to maintain
friendly relations with the Scottish Protestants, and
to help them to a predominance which should yet
depend for its security on the goodwill of England.</p>

<p>It was not till December 1560, that the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Francis deprived Mary of the French crown. During
these first two years of Elizabeth’s reign, Philip was
kept in play partly by a pretence of negotiations for
the Queen’s marriage to his kinsman the Austrian
Archduke Charles; while the Scottish Protestants,
or Lords of the Congregation, as their chiefs were
called, were flattered by the idea of her marriage
with James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, who then stood
next in succession to the Scottish throne&mdash;a scheme
of which the real motive was the possibility of
dethroning Mary in his favour. But the real business
was to get the French out of Scotland. Cecil at last
manœuvred his mistress into sending armed assistance
to the Lords of the Congregation; the French
garrison was cooped up in Leith; in May 1560, Sir
William went to Scotland himself to negotiate; in
June Mary of Guise died, and in the beginning of
July the Treaty of Edinburgh secured the Protestant
ascendency in Scotland, and removed the French
garrison for ever. Although Queen Mary refused
to ratify the instrument, consistently declining formally
to withdraw her claim to the throne of England
unless she were equally formally recognised as heir
presumptive, Cecil’s great object was achieved, in
spite of Elizabeth’s vacillations.</p>

<p>Thirteen months later, Mary, an eighteen-year-old
widow, landed in Scotland. During the seven
troublous years she passed in that country, Cecil’s
policy remained the same&mdash;to support Scottish
Protestantism, to prevent Mary from making a
marriage that would be dangerous to England. It is
hardly necessary to say that the methods were never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
qualified by any touch of magnanimity&mdash;that the
interests of England solely were considered, those
of Scotland disregarded. How much of what went
on, on the part of England, was Cecil’s doing and
how much Elizabeth’s, cannot well be decided.
They may or may not have intended the Darnley
marriage to take place. They did encourage Moray’s
revolt on that occasion, and then repudiate responsibility
for it. They knew something&mdash;how much
is uncertain&mdash;about the Rizzio murder, before it
took place. Generally, we can be tolerably confident
that Cecil, unfettered, would have given Moray a
more stable support throughout than it pleased his
mistress to permit. It was Elizabeth’s standing
rule to object vehemently to being considered as
having committed herself to anything by any words
or acts in which she might have indulged.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">CECIL AND PROTESTANTISM</span></h3>

<p>Cecil had been successful in turning the French
out of Scotland. He held steadily, and the queen
held unsteadily, to the conviction that Spain would
not move against England for two reasons&mdash;one,
that the triumph of the Scots queen would be too
advantageous to France; the other, that the existing
commercial war with the Low Countries, while bad
enough for English trade, was threatening to ruin
Flanders, and could hardly fail to do so if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
further burden were added. France, on the other
hand, was not likely to be actively dangerous independently,
so long as neither Catholics nor Huguenots
could lay the opposing party prostrate. Nevertheless,
Cecil had to be constantly on guard against
the risk of a Catholic combination. If Mary placed
herself under the ægis of Philip, and the Guises and
their following got his active support in France&mdash;if
he played to the French Catholics the part which
England was playing to the Scottish Protestants&mdash;he
might reckon himself free of the fear of French
advancement. The thing was not a probability,
but it was a chance against which England had to be
on the watch. Every time, however, that a crisis of
this kind threatened, or that a Spanish ambassador
hinted that his master would feel himself driven
into active antagonism, the Secretary refused to
be frightened; direct threats always stiffened his
mistress; and his calculation turned out correct.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Cecil’s whole system of foreign
policy was the theory that Philip as Lord of Burgundy
could not, for commercial reasons, afford to
quarrel with England, and as King of Spain was tied
by the danger of strengthening France. Spain, then,
was not to be feared, but France might be; this,
however, would be conditional on the Huguenots
being decisively crushed&mdash;a consummation not desired
by Catherine and the <i>Politiques</i>; but this, in
turn, required that the French Huguenots should
have enough support from England to maintain
their power of resistance, if not their domination.
As time went on, and the Protestant Netherlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
found themselves in open armed resistance to Philip,
it was in just the same way necessary for England
to keep them from being crushed. Cecil saw the
necessity of thus abetting the Protestants in Scotland,
France, and the Netherlands; and, being a
genuine Protestant if not an over-ardent one, did
not dislike it. Elizabeth saw the necessity also, but
as in each case the Protestants were subjects acting
in opposition to the Government, she did dislike it,
and lost no opportunity of making the support she
gave as ungracious, as niggardly, and as precarious
as she dared, while she perpetually kept up a sort
of pretence to herself as well as to others that she
was not really helping those whom she called rebels.
Yet without the help that was wrung from her, it is
doubtful whether in France, in the Netherlands, or
even in Scotland, the issue of the struggles during
her reign would not have been materially different.</p>

<p>Now Cecil’s ideal was one of sober and opulent
respectability; he was not troubled with any notion
that the Pope was the Scarlet Woman; he held
generally to the view that subjects ought to conform
to the religion prescribed by Government. But
where the views which he himself held were not
prescribed but proscribed, decency compelled sympathy
with the sufferers. Besides, the suppression
of Protestantism outside of England would inevitably
mean its suppression in England also, in course of
time. He was thoroughly satisfied that Protestantism
was best for England, and thus, although
he had no abstract interest in what might be
good for other countries, for England’s sake he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
was satisfied that Protestantism must not be suppressed
elsewhere. This was the mark up to which
he had to keep the Queen&mdash;who, for her part, was
quite aware that the security of her throne depended
on her sustaining the part laid down for her. But
Cecil’s minimum was her maximum, whereas his
maximum&mdash;with which she would have nothing to
do&mdash;was the minimum that would have satisfied
her other great minister, Walsingham.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, we may put it, felt that Protestantism
was a political necessity for her personal government.
She did not feel strongly that it would still be a
necessity for England when she should be in her
grave. Cecil did; while for Walsingham it was a
necessity <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>. Therefore, to Elizabeth the settlement
of the succession was a political counter of
which she did not choose to be deprived; while to
her ministers the delay of it was a perpetual nightmare,
because it meant a constant fear of the accession
of Mary Stewart&mdash;a prospect even more threatening
after she had left Scotland than while she was a
reigning queen. Herein is to be found one of the
reasons why Elizabeth was not anxious to get rid
of a prisoner round whom&mdash;dangerous though Mary
might be&mdash;she could weave intrigues and negotiations
as well as her opponents; whereas Cecil and
Walsingham would always have been pleased to find
any decent excuse for eliminating the Scots Queen
from the situation. In the same way, the ministers
wanted their own Queen to make a suitable marriage,
whereas she herself used matrimonial negotiations
merely as tricks for circumventing crises, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
probably never at any time really intended to wed
any one among the numerous suitors, of whom the
last did not finally disappear till she was in her
fiftieth year. There is no practical doubt that at
one time, early in the reign, Cecil was himself so
much perturbed on the question of the succession
as to have made a move in co-operation with Nicholas
Bacon to get Katharine Grey&mdash;sister of Lady Jane,
and now married to Lord Hertford&mdash;recognised
officially as heir presumptive in accordance with the
terms of the will of Henry VIII.; for which he very
nearly got into serious trouble. Also, it was many
years before the Secretary really felt thoroughly free
from the fear, which Elizabeth enjoyed holding in
suspense over his head, that she might some day
throw policy to the winds and court ruin by marrying
Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">ELIZABETH’S SECOND PERIOD</span></h3>

<p>The year 1568 and those immediately following
had a very material effect on the general situation.
In the first place, the Queen of Scots delivered
herself into Elizabeth’s hands, having already forfeited
some of her chances of foreign support by
her marriage with Bothwell. In the second place,
the disaffected provinces of the Netherlands were
driven into open revolt. Broadly speaking, it may
be said that from this time forward Philip always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
wished to crush Elizabeth, while he would not
involve himself in war with England until he could
reckon on crushing her decisively. There was always
the possibility of an Anglo-French combination,
involving Huguenot predominance in France; and
in that event the fleets of the two Powers would
command his only line of communication with the
Netherlands. So that on the one hand Spaniards
are found, throughout Mary’s captivity, engaged in
plot after plot for her liberation and enthronement
in England; while on the other, Philip is obliged to
swallow one affront after another, and to vary
threats of utter destruction with elaborate efforts
to placate the Queen of England. Cecil&mdash;Lord
Burghley, as he became in 1571&mdash;was no less anxious
to avoid war, but was also determined to go as far as
might be, short of war, in support of the insurgent
provinces; while steadily accumulating the evidence
of Spanish complicity in Marian plots, to be produced
as an effective answer to any complaints that
England was abetting treason in the Netherlands,
or her seamen committing acts of war in the Spanish
Main or the West Indian Islands.</p>

<p>The Protestantism of the Government stiffened
inevitably with the development of Catholic plots
centring on Mary, the atrocities perpetrated by
Alva in the Netherlands, the cruelties practised by
the Spanish Inquisition on English sailors who fell
into its hands, and the blundering Papal Bull of
deposition&mdash;which, in fact, embarrassed Philip a
good deal more than it injured the Queen of England.
This singularly impolitic act of the Roman Pontiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
emphasising the direct antagonism, not to say the
irreconcilability, of loyalty to the Throne and
loyalty to the Church, sufficed in itself to bring all
Catholics under suspicion of being at heart traitors&mdash;in
the technical sense; pledged by their faith to
desire, if not actively to compass, the overthrow of
the reigning queen. Preceded, as it was, by the
insurrection of the northern Catholic Earls in Mary’s
favour, and followed by the Ridolfi conspiracy, it is
difficult to perceive how the Queen’s government
could have done otherwise than assume that to be a
Catholic was to be disaffected. Nor is it possible
to imagine that, after the appalling St. Bartholomew
massacres of 1572, anti-Catholic sentiment in the
country was not intensified to a white heat.</p>

<p>The people of England had a further grievance
against Spain, inasmuch as she had taken possession
of the wealth of the New World, and meant to keep
it for herself&mdash;whereas the English desired a share.
Throughout the later sixties and the seventies,
English adventurers were engaged in making good
their claims, in spite of nominal peace and law, by
force of arms, raiding Spanish settlements or compelling
local authorities to allow them to trade in
defiance of all injunctions from headquarters. Technically,
at least, these proceedings amounted to
piracy, and if the Spaniards had been content to
treat their perpetrators as pirates, it would have
been extremely difficult to protest. Having an
almost incontrovertible case, the Spaniards elected
to put themselves in the wrong by punishing their
prisoners&mdash;when they caught them&mdash;not as pirates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
but as heretics, gratuitously introducing the religious
factor. Even in 1568 English sailors, under such
captains as John Hawkins, had learnt to feel that
ship for ship they were very much more than a
match for Spanish galleons. Thus the most adventurous
and most irrepressible class in the community
was athirst to measure its strength with the Spaniard,
and found no difficulty in convincing itself that to
do so was a religious duty. The spirit of rivalry,
greed of wealth, and sheer love of adventure, formed
a sufficiently strong combination of motives; zeal
against the persecutors of true religion gave them a
colour which satisfied any but the most fastidious
consciences.</p>

<p>Now, it will be easy to see from the foregoing
paragraphs that already in 1568 enough had occurred
to inflame popular feeling against Spain. There were
the doings of the Spanish Inquisition in respect of
English sailors. There was, amongst other grievances,
the attack on John Hawkins at San Juan
d’Ulloa. There was Alva’s tyranny in the Netherlands.
In France, no one could tell whether Huguenots
or Catholics were going to get the upper
hand; but Philip was fully committed to the suppression
of heresy within his own dominions, and
outside them as well so far as it might lie in his
power. During the next four years, every event of
importance went to intensify the sentiment against
Spain, to which, and not to France, the Ridolfi plot
pointed as Mary’s ally. On the other hand, it was
evident at once, when Elizabeth was able to detain
in her own ports for her own use the treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
which was on its way up channel to help Alva,
that for the time Philip was too heavily hampered
to be able to turn his full strength against
England; and as time went on it became increasingly
clear that Spain could not, with the Netherlands
revolt on her hands, contemplate an English war
with equanimity. Even Saint Bartholomew did not
divert the hostile sentiment in the direction of
France, since still after the massacre it was difficult
to say whether the French nation should be identified
with the party of the perpetrators rather than with
that of the victims.</p>

<p>At the lowest estimate, then, there was a mass of
feeling in the country which could very easily have
been fanned into a blaze of indignation, imperatively
demanding open defiance of Spain, vigorous support
of the Netherlands and of the Huguenots&mdash;in short,
immediate war instead of the chance of war in the
future. But the Queen and Burghley were determined
to avoid war; and for nearly twenty years
they succeeded. Burghley’s own primary conviction
was that amity between Burgundy and England was
of such enormous importance to both that considerations
of policy would prevent Philip, as they
had prevented his father, from being dragged into
war by considerations of religious zeal. Protestantism&mdash;so
much of it, at least, as was necessary&mdash;could
be saved, probably without adopting heroic
courses; and in any case, if a duel should ultimately
prove inevitable, every year that it was deferred
would tell in favour of England, which was daily
growing in wealth, in stability, and in efficiency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
and against Spain, which was constantly subjected
to the exhausting strain of war in the Low Countries
and war with the Turk.</p>

<p>Ultimate friendship with Spain, on the basis of
immunity for unaggressive Protestantism, mutual
toleration, and unfettered trade, was broadly the
ideal for which Burghley worked; to achieve it, he
was ready to bring to bear any amount of pressure
which would not actually precipitate war. But it
was part of the policy always to make sure that there
was, at any rate, technical justification for everything
done by the English Government. This technical
correctness is particularly characteristic of the
man. While Elizabeth herself and nearly every
man in her court, were all shareholders, or in some
degree interested, in the privateering expeditions of
Drake and other captains, Burghley held himself
rigidly aloof from them, and never made a penny of
personal profit in that way. He had no moral
qualms about seizing the Genoese treasure in 1568&mdash;that
was merely an arrangement by which the bankers
lent to England money which they had intended to
lend to Spain; if it inconvenienced Spain, Spain
should not have seized the English ships in her
harbours. But when Drake came home after sailing
round the world, with vast quantities of captured
treasure in the <i>Golden Hind</i>, Burghley stigmatised
the whole proceedings as piratical, declined any
share of the spoil, and would have had it restored
to Spain.</p>

<p>In this connection, the Lord <span class="locked">Treasurer’s<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></span> aversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
to these raiding expeditions was so strong that when
Drake’s great voyage was in contemplation the
utmost pains were taken to keep the matter out of
his knowledge. But there were very few things that
Burghley did not succeed in being aware of; and
one of the gentleman-adventurers who sailed in that
expedition, Thomas Doughty, was in personal communication
with him before it started. This man
was executed by Drake at Port St. Julian, in Patagonia&mdash;one
of the grounds on which he was held
guilty of treason towards the “General,” Drake,
being that he had admittedly revealed as much as
he knew to Burghley. The fact that inquiry into
that execution was carefully shirked, while the
recorded evidence is somewhat contradictory and
inconclusive, has led to the formation of various
surmises to the disfavour of Drake, of Burghley, of
Doughty, or of the witnesses, according to the
point of view of the critic. The most natural interpretation
would seem to be that in the first place
Drake and the sailors in general suspected gentleman-adventurers
at large of being an objectionably insubordinate
and troublesome element; and the General
may very possibly have been injudicially ready to
condemn one of them on insufficient evidence&mdash;evidence
which satisfied him but did not amount to
legal proof&mdash;and fancied that collusion with the
antagonistic Lord Treasurer implied certainly ill-will
and probably treachery to the commander. Applying
those current rules of evidence which repeatedly
sufficed to condemn men for treason at home, the
case for executing Doughty was quite strong enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
to act on, though exceedingly awkward to make
public. It would show, of course, that the sailor
was very suspicious of the designs of the statesman
from whom the Queen wanted to have the thing
concealed; it also suggests that Elizabeth liked to
do behind the minister’s back, if she could manage
it, the things which she knew he would disapprove.
But it does not involve anything outrageous on
Drake’s part, or any real discredit to the Lord
Treasurer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Burghley was made Lord High Treasurer in 1572.</p></div>

<p>In fact, for a dozen years after Saint Bartholomew,
while Burghley and the Queen had the same main
object in view, though others of the Council were
urgent in favour of her presenting herself openly as
the champion of Protestantism, Burghley’s difficulties
were mainly of Elizabeth’s creating. To all
appearance, she was in a state of ceaseless vacillation&mdash;now
on the verge of a shameful betrayal of Orange,
now on the brink of a French marriage, now on the
point of announcing her readiness to head a League
of Protestants, now of allowing them to take their
chance with the preposterous Alençon as their
figure-head, while she stood aside, and anon dangling
her matrimonial bait before that luckless and incapable
prince as a preferable alternative. Burghley,
Walsingham, all her advisers, were repeatedly driven
almost to despair by her vagaries; none knew what
her next twist would be&mdash;yet every twist that
seemed to produce a fresh entanglement was followed
by another which evaded it; and always as an
open breach with Spain or a flagrant rupture with
France seemed really a thing immediately inevitable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
some happy accident appeared to save the situation
once more.</p>

<h3>VII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WAR WITH SPAIN</span></h3>

<p>It would seem, however, that the discovery of the
Throgmorton conspiracy led Burghley in the beginning
of 1584 to the conclusion that a bolder support
should be given to the Netherlands, more especially
as the Alençon farce was finished. In 1585, Elizabeth
committed herself to the Hollanders, Drake
went off on the Cartagena raid, and in 1586 Leicester
was in the Low Countries in command of the English
troops. Then came the Babington plot, the execution
of the Queen of Scots after the New Year, the
certainty of Philip’s preparations for the Armada,
and the “singeing of the King of Spain’s beard”
by Drake, which deferred the great invasion for a
twelvemonth; finally the week-long battle with the
Armada itself, ending in its destruction off Gravelines,
and subsequent annihilation by the tempests. To
the very last Elizabeth went on playing at negotiations
with Parma, on lines involving the basest
treachery to the Hollanders; to the entire satisfaction
of Sir James Crofts whom she employed in the
business, and who is known to have been in Philip’s
pay. This, however, was merely one of her regular
pieces of diplomatic play-acting; while Burghley
kept his own counsel. The war-party lived on
thorns; they did not know what to make of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
trickery, whether it was genuine or a sham. Howard
of Effingham, in fiery wrath, wrote&mdash;quoting an old
byword&mdash;of the “long grey beard with a white head
witless that to all the world would prove England
heart-less,” <i>i.e.</i>, cowardly. Still, though it would
have been natural enough for them to suspect that
the peace-loving Burghley was abetting the Queen,
the probabilities are that Effingham was referring
not to him but to Crofts. Retreat without dishonour
was impossible; he certainly would not
have advocated it seriously; and the elaborate farce
which Elizabeth deliberately played was merely a
piece of that eternally baffling and exasperating
diplomacy of which she might be called the inventor
and patentee&mdash;methods which Burghley always condemned,
though probably his long experience of
them had by this time taught him to see through
them. From 1584 he recognised that events had
forced his own peace-loving policy out of court, and
that it could not be revived till the issue between
England and Spain had been fought out. The
completeness of England’s triumph when the combatants
did crash together in mortal fray went far,
at any rate, to justify the theory on which he had
systematically acted that, if the fight must come,
the longer it could be staved off the more decisively
it would favour his own country.</p>

<p>The wild outburst of enthusiasm following on the
defeat of the Armada very nearly delivered the
future of England into the hands of the Protestant
war-party, whose desire was to break the power of
Spain to pieces; and through the winter Drake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Norreys were preparing for the Lisbon expedition
which, as they planned it, would have been another
very crushing blow to Philip. But the great victory
had brought Burghley’s ideal back into the sphere of
practical politics. That is, if English and Spaniards
could be brought to see reason, or to act as if they
saw reason, an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entente</i> might now be established
securing religious toleration and the recognition of
the old Constitution in the Netherlands, the old
Burgundian alliance with its corollary of commercial
privileges and legitimate trading with Spanish
settlements all over the world, and the immunity of
English sailors from the Inquisition. With Spain
as an allied Power, whatever might come of the
party strife in France, England would have nothing
to fear. The aggressive sentiment in England was,
indeed, too strong to be repressed; but though the
present continuation of the war was inevitable, it
might be so manipulated as to bring it home to the
obstinate mind of Philip that peace on Burghley’s
terms would be a very good bargain for him, without
making a total wreck of the power of Spain.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, as usual, was at one with Burghley on
the point, and with Burghley’s son Robert Cecil,
who was now drawing to the front and making it
possible for his father to transfer to him much of
the burden of active work for which he was becoming
unfitted by age. The main method by which the
policy was given effect was by placing the conduct
of the war as far as possible in the hands of that
section of the war-party, headed by John Hawkins
among the seamen and by Essex at Court, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
thought more of booty than of Empire&mdash;which did
not realise, with Drake and Raleigh, that the despoiling
of treasure-fleets and the sacking of ports
would accomplish very much less than the annihilation
of fighting fleets and the establishment in the
New World of rival English settlements. Thus, by
the time Drake started for Lisbon, he found his hands
so tied by restrictions as to what he was to do and
what he was not to do that the expedition failed of
its purpose. Drake was discredited in consequence,
and for some years the war became a mere series of
raids; conducted in force, indeed, and openly avowed
and authorised by the Queen, but not in essence
differing from the semi-piratical performances of the
Drakes and Hawkinses when Spain and England
were nominally at peace. Hence, in 1598, when
Burghley and Philip both died within a few weeks of
each other, Spain had been invariably defeated in
every successive attempt to strike a blow at her
rival; she had suffered a serious disaster at Cadiz;
her treasure-ships had been repeatedly raided; her
enemy, Henry of Navarre, had carried the day in
France: but her hold on the New World remained,
she was still an effective Power in Europe, and the
fear of her was not yet dead, though England still
held, and more than held, the priority she had won
ten years before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">AN APPRECIATION</span></h3>

<p>In foreign policy we have seen that, at any rate
in the broader aspects of it, Burghley and Elizabeth
were at one&mdash;that is, the Queen never departed so
far from the path he laid down but that she could
regain her footing thereon the moment a crisis
arrived. That policy may be summed up as aiming
at one issue&mdash;friendship with Spain on an equality&mdash;while
preparing for the alternative, a fight for the
mastery. The policy failed to achieve the preferable
issue, but in its secondary aspect was completely
successful. Burghley’s own methods were not of
the heroic type; there was no glamour of chivalry
and knight-errantry about them; they were untouched
by magnanimity, generosity, moral enthusiasm;
they were ruled by a devotion to law and
order, to propriety, to sober respectability; they
were entirely practical, unsympathetic; but they
were essentially marked at least with the intention
of strict justice and reasonableness.</p>

<p>The same characteristics present themselves in his
domestic policy. In the religious settlement and in
finance the course taken throughout the reign is
along the broad lines laid down by him; the Queen
permits herself to indulge in personal outbreaks, and
sets the general scheme at naught in individual
instances, but, if she flies off at a tangent, still manages
to return before it is too late, before any general
deflection has been brought about. And again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
desire of essential practical justice is the predominating
feature. Zeal for particular religious views,
however sincere, must not be permitted to disturb
public order; the decencies must be observed, but
the decencies would allow of as much latitude as
reasonable men could desire. If zeal went the
length of harbouring and fostering persons whose
doctrines might be interpreted as impugning the
right of the Queen to sit on the throne of England,
justice required that such zeal should be penalised;
if, further, zeal propagated such doctrines actively,
zeal became treason. So, when Parsons and Campion
came over with their propaganda, the Catholic
persecution which followed had Burghley’s entire
approval; nonconformity, aggressive and abusive,
he was quite ready to punish with severity, but when
Archbishop Whitgift and his Court of High Commission
set about hunting for nonconformity, Burghley
was for restraining them though the Queen sympathised
not with him but with them. A more
sensitive and sympathetic imagination would often
have been alive to the existence of real injustice
where the Lord Treasurer failed to perceive it; but
where he did perceive it he always endeavoured to
moderate it, even though he might not set his face
stubbornly against it. His gorge rose at the stories
of atrocities perpetrated in Ireland which almost
every one else seems to have taken as a matter of
course. If the use of the rack met with his approval
it was only in cases where he honestly believed that
the ends of justice were thereby furthered; and
though the practice had not been common in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
England, its prevalence elsewhere was so general
that its increased employment involved no shock
to the moral sense of contemporaries.</p>

<p>Burghley’s principles of political action, then, were
quite remote from those of Machiavelli and Thomas
Cromwell, according to which the slightest claim of
political expediency outweighed the entire moral code,
and ethical considerations were reduced at the best
to a sentiment which under certain circumstances
it might be expedient to humour. His principles
were equally remote from those of Somerset, which
ignored the fact that no ends, however noble, can be
achieved by disregarding hard facts. He insisted
on upholding a moral standard in policy, and maintained
a moral standard in his personal political
relations. Admitting the principle <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">salus populi
suprema lex</i>, he allowed that supreme necessity
might over-ride the moral law, but there were few
of his contemporaries who were not very much
readier than he to recognise such an exigency on
slight provocation. On the other hand, while his
personal standard was so high that even his bitterest
foes among the Spanish ambassadors acknowledged
it with abusive candour, his normal political standard
was that of his times. We may, perhaps, express it
by saying that he had an almost abnormally strong
sense of political proprieties but a complete absence
of moral fervour.</p>

<p>Intellectually, he lacked imagination, while no
statesman was ever endowed with a more imperturbably
shrewd common sense, which served as
perpetual ballast to counteract the flightiness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
mistress. He worked as assiduously as Philip of
Spain himself, but, unlike Philip, he knew when to
trust other men, never misplacing his confidence&mdash;whereas
Philip never trusted any other man an inch
further than he could help. Burghley’s extreme
caution was due, not to lack of courage or of self-confidence,
but to a thorough distrust of all emotional
impulses. He weighed, deliberated, decided
on the merits of each case as it arose, with careful
and safe judgment; but had none of those flashes
of intuitive perception which have characterised the
most triumphant types of political genius. He ruled,
not by magnetism, but by tact. Among statesmen
he was of the order of Walpole and Peel, not of
Oliver Cromwell and Chatham. He was lacking in
creative imagination; but he was, perhaps, the most
thoroughly level-headed minister who has ever
guided the destinies of England. He cannot be
elevated into an object of hero-worship. But he
was precisely the type of man of whom his
country had most need at the helm in the second
half of the sixteenth century; and he served her
as perhaps no other man could have done, with unswerving
patriotism, sturdy resolution, and infinite
devotion to duty.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="FRANCIS_WALSINGHAM">SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM</h2>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">WALSINGHAM’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p>Of the many Englishmen, who, by loyal service to
the nation in the reign of the Virgin Queen, deserved
well of the State, there is perhaps not one whose
claim stands higher than that of Walsingham.
For twenty years, or near it, Elizabeth trusted him
more completely than any of her council, except
Burghley, relied on his ability and his fidelity
to carry out every task of exceptional difficulty,
profited by his devotion, his penetration, and his
resourcefulness, rejected his advice on the cardinal
question of policy till she was compelled by circumstances
in some measure to adopt it, suffered him to
ruin his fortunes in her service, and finally permitted
him to die the poorest of all her Ministers. It
was said, in the study of Burghley, that she was
loyal to him; she was so, in the sense that nothing
would induce her to part from him. Unlike many
other princes, when she found a good servant, she
never let him go from personal pique, or on account of
differences; her loyalty was the loyalty of a very
acute woman, but one wholly devoid of generosity.
His loyalty she left to be its own reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Walsingham won his position by sheer force of
ability and character; qualities in him which
were probably discovered by the penetration of
William Cecil, with whom he was always on the
most cordial terms, although himself the advocate
of a much bolder policy than was favoured by the
cautious Lord Treasurer. None could say of Walsingham,
as his enemies have said of Cecil, that he
was in any degree a time-server; he was not only
as incorruptible, but it could never be hinted that
in affairs of State his line of action was deflected
by a hair’s-breadth by any considerations of personal
advantage or advancement. He indulged in none
of those arts of courtiership which not only a
Leicester, a Hatton, or an Essex, but even a Raleigh,
took no shame in employing to extravagance.
Not Knollys nor Hunsdon, her own outspoken
kinsmen, could be more blunt and outspoken to
their royal mistress than he. It would be difficult
to find in the long roll of English statesmen one
more resolutely disinterested, or one whose services,
being admittedly so great, were rewarded so
meagrely.</p>

<p>There are diversities of conscientiousness. Henry
VIII. referred most questions to his conscience,
after he had made up his mind about the answer;
and his conscience always endorsed his judgment.
Cromwell ignored conscience altogether; with More,
it overruled every other consideration. Burghley’s
was tolerably active, but perhaps somewhat obtuse.
Walsingham, if we read him aright, was as rigidly
conscientious as More himself; but his moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
standard requires to be understood before it can be
appreciated. It was derived, not from the New
Testament, but from the Old. It assumed that
the Protestants were in the position of the ancient
Hebrews; that they were the Chosen People, and
their enemies, the enemies of the Lord of Sabaoth.
It justified the spoiling of the Egyptians. It was
sufficiently tempered to disapprove the extermination
of the Canaanite, but it hardly condemned
Ehud and Jael. Broadly speaking it applied
different moral codes in dealing with the foes of
the Faith and in other relations. Identifying the
foes of the Faith with the enemies of the State, it
authorised the use, in self-defence, of every weapon
and every artifice employed on the other side. It
was not with him as with those to whom the law
serves for conscience; who will do with a light heart
anything that the law permits, and shrink in horror
from anything that it condemns. Nor did he act
on the principle that the right must give way to the
expedient. With him, conscience positively approved
in one group of relations the adoption of
practices which in other relations it would have
sternly denounced. That type of conscience is
absolutely genuine and sincere; but it permits
actions which are, to say the least, censurable from
a more enlightened point of view.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">WALSINGHAM’S RISE</span></h3>

<p>The records of Walsingham’s early years are
somewhat scanty. An uncle was Lieutenant of the
Tower during the latter part of the reign of Henry
VIII.; of whom it is reported that when Anne
Askew was on the rack, he refused to strain the
torture to the point desired by Wriothesly. His
father was a considerable landed proprietor at
Chiselhurst, and filled sundry minor legal offices.
He died in 1533, leaving several daughters and one
son, Francis, an infant, born not earlier than 1530,
and so ten years younger than William Cecil. Young
Walsingham was up at King’s College, Cambridge,
from 1548 to 1550, and entered Gray’s Inn in 1552.</p>

<p>Being of the advanced Reformation party, young
Walsingham quitted the country on Mary’s accession,
remained abroad during the five years of her
rule, and returned when Elizabeth succeeded, to
take his place in the House of Commons. His
sojourn abroad emphasised his Protestantism; he
utilised it also to acquire a very extensive knowledge
of foreign affairs, though he omitted to make himself
a master of the Spanish tongue. He does not
appear to have taken prominent part in the affairs
of Parliament when he came back to England;
but he attracted Cecil’s notice, and was employed by
the Secretary in procuring secret intelligence, of
which the earliest definite record is a report of
August 1568, giving a “descriptive list of suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
persons arriving in Italy during the space of three
months,” obtained from “Franchiotto the Italian.”
On November 20 of the same year, he writes to
Cecil to say that, if the evidence of Mary’s complicity
in Darnley’s murder is insufficient, “my
friend is able to discover certain that should have
been employed in the said murder, who are here to
be produced.” Incidentally, it may be remarked
that this, of course, means no more than that Walsingham
knew where to lay his hand on some one who
professed to have information; which Mr. Froude
renders by a phrase implying that he actually had
information, known to be valuable, ready to be
brought forward. What it really shows is, that
Walsingham was engaged in looking out for anything
which offered a chance of being turned to
account.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the following year, just before
the rising of the northern earls, when it was practically
certain that some kind of Catholic plot was
afoot and that the Spanish ambassador, Don Guerau
de Espes was mixed up in it, circumstances brought
the Florentine banker Ridolfi under suspicion. The
position to which Walsingham was now attaining
is shown by the Italian being assigned to his surveillance&mdash;with
the result that Ridolfi’s house and
papers were thoroughly searched without his knowledge,
but also without the discovery of anything
incriminating. Whether honestly or with the object
of deceiving him, Ridolfi was thereupon treated as
if no vestige of suspicion attached to him. In the
modern phrase, it was an integral part of Walsingham’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
system in dealing with persons on whom he
expected to pounce when his own time came, to
give them every inch of rope he could afford: but a
year later Walsingham wrote about the man to
Cecil in terms which imply that the belief in his
honesty was genuine. When the whole of the
Ridolfi plot was revealed in 1571, Walsingham was
in France. The secret service was Cecil’s creation,
not Walsingham’s, though doubtless the latter had
a considerable share in organising it, and a little
later became mainly responsible for controlling it.
Valuable as he was already rendering himself, he
only emerges definitely into the front rank on his
appointment as a special envoy to the French Court
in August 1570; followed immediately thereafter
by his selection for the post of Ambassador Resident.</p>

<p>The situation at this time was exceedingly critical.
At home, the northern insurrection had just been
suppressed, Norfolk and others of the peers were
very much subjects of suspicion, and the Papal
Bull of deposition had increased the sense of nervousness.
The Spanish representative in England was
the hot-headed and intriguing Don Guerau de
Espes; in the Netherlands, Alva had made the
world in general believe&mdash;though he knew better
himself&mdash;that the revolt was crushed. In France
the Huguenots, despite defeat in the field, had just
shown themselves strong enough to obtain, through
the balancing party of the Politiques, terms which
placed them fairly on a level with the Guise faction;
but a marriage was being planned between Henry
of Anjou, the king’s next brother and heir presumptive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
and the imprisoned Queen of Scots. In
Scotland itself, the assassination of Moray had
revived the confusion which the sombre regent had
been struggling to allay. Thus, there was danger to
Elizabeth’s throne from her own Catholic subjects;
danger from France, since Anjou was regarded as
of the Guise party; and danger, imagined at least,
from Spain, where that surprising charlatan, Stukely,
had almost, if not quite, persuaded Philip that at
his call&mdash;with some armed assistance&mdash;all Ireland
would rise, fling off the English yoke, and offer
itself to Spain. As a matter of fact, Philip was much
too heavily hampered to take openly aggressive
action against England at the time&mdash;but that was
known to very few people besides himself and Alva.</p>

<p>These difficulties of Philip’s were the first redeeming
feature in the situation. The second was that
on which Cecil always relied, that the national
interests of France and Spain were too antagonistic
to permit of any cordial alliance between them.
Mary Stewart on the English throne as Philip’s
<i>protégée</i> would not suit France; as Anjou’s wife
she would not suit Philip. France might at any
time see her own interest in fostering the revolt in
the Netherlands and intriguing for their Protectorate.
The third point was that in France itself, the
Politiques were at one with the Huguenots in wishing
to avoid the union of Anjou with Mary, which would
be a great victory for the Guises; so that the balance
of forces in France would turn definitely in favour
of England if she could offer anything in the way of
a make-weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Such were the conditions under which Walsingham
was sent to France as a special envoy in August
1570&mdash;to congratulate the French Government on
the pacification just concluded; to urge the necessity
of maintaining it loyally; and to dissuade the
Court from espousing the cause of the Scots Queen.
Within a month, he received official intimation that
the resident Ambassador, Sir Henry Norris, was
about to be recalled, and he was himself to succeed
to the post; which arrangement took effect in
January.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">AMBASSADOR AT PARIS</span></h3>

<p>In the interval, an ingenious solution of several
problems had suggested itself to the Huguenot
leaders, and found favour with the Queen-Mother.
This was that Anjou should drop the idea of marrying
Mary and should instead marry Elizabeth
herself. He was her junior by seventeen years,
but that was a small matter. If he wedded the
Protestant Queen, he would be definitely detached
from the Guises, toleration for both religions would
be assured both in England and France, and the
two countries could join in the liberation of the
Netherlands. The problem would be to arrange the
marriage on terms which would give the parties
who were favourably disposed to it security for the
carrying out of those parts of the programme which
were from their several points of view essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prima facie</i> the plan was acceptable to the
Huguenots, to the Politiques, to the English Council,
and to Walsingham himself. To the Guises, it was
very much the reverse, and they tried, with a
degree of success, to frighten the Duke with the old
scandals about the Virgin Queen and Leicester. The
Spaniards were much perturbed. Their Ambassador
first tried to draw the French into engagements
with them against Orange; and, failing in that
attempt, began making overtures to Walsingham
which he appreciated at their true value. He
knew all about the overtures to France&mdash;to which,
as the Englishman wrote drily to Cecil, “the
answers falling not out to his contentment, maketh
him, as I suppose, to think that the friendship of
England is worth the having.” The same letter
notes information that the Pope has a “practice in
hand for England, which would not be long before
it brake forth”&mdash;no doubt in connexion with the
Ridolfi plot, which was now maturing.</p>

<p>Side by side with the business of the Anjou
marriage, Walsingham was much engaged in gathering
information as to the suspected Spanish expedition
to Ireland; in respect of which he held much
diplomatic conversation with the ex-Archbishop of
Cashel and heard many tales of Stukely’s doings
and sayings. Walsingham suspected his good faith,
and remarked significantly to Cecil&mdash;who had just
been “ordered to write William Burleigh” instead
of William Cecil, but had still some difficulty in
remembering the new signature&mdash;“I have placed
some especially about him, to whom he repaireth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
as also who repairs unto him.” The suspicions were
not dissipated as time went on.</p>

<p>The Ambassador’s situation was one of singular
difficulty. For a dozen years past, Elizabeth had
played fast and loose with so many suitors that any
lack of straightforwardness on her part was certain
to be construed as meaning that she intended to
play with Anjou in the same way; while she was
absolutely incapable of being straightforward. As
a matter of fact, she was probably merely playing
her usual game. So long as the match was on the
<i>tapis</i>, but only on the <i>tapis</i>, Philip would be afraid
to move lest he should precipitate it. Meantime,
Orange was making ready to renew the struggle in
the Netherlands, and she might presently find that
she could afford to manœuvre herself out of the
marriage, and would have skill enough to make the
rupture of negotiations come from the other side.
Burghley and Leicester both wanted the match&mdash;the
former being satisfied that it would result in
the Burgundian dominions being separated from
Spain without being absorbed by France, while
Protestantism would be generally much strengthened.
But in his private correspondence with Walsingham,
he warned the Ambassador very plainly that neither
he nor Leicester knew what the Queen meant to do&mdash;it
was as likely as not that she wished in the long
run to get the match broken off by Anjou on the
score of the English stipulations for his conforming
to the English law in matters of religion. Walsingham,
who was a Protestant with his heart and soul
as well as his head, and believed that the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
cause was the national cause much more uncompromisingly
than Burghley, was more zealous on
behalf of the marriage than the Secretary himself,
being convinced that it would bring about the
victory of Protestantism, in alliance with England,
both in France and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It was not Burghley nor Walsingham, but Elizabeth,
who controlled the situation; and however
strongly the ministers might express their private
feelings to each other, they had to do as she told
them. Her trickery met with its usual success.
In due course, Henry of Anjou found that he could
not accede to the demand for conformity, and in
spite of his mother’s entreaties withdrew his suit;
yet the business was so successfully managed that
the French court, instead of being offended, very
soon began to hint that the French king had yet
another brother, the Duke of Alençon, whose hand
and heart were not yet disposed of. So the play
began again.</p>

<p>Meantime the complete revelation of the Ridolfi
conspiracy brought conclusive proofs of the real
hostility of Spain to Elizabeth. In the following
spring (1572) the Netherlands were set ablaze once
more by La Marck’s capture of Brille, and Alva found
his hands full; a timely occurrence, since the
crushing defeat of the Turks at Lepanto by Don
John in October had greatly strengthened the
hands of Philip. In the summer of 1572 Walsingham
was more than ever convinced that a French
marriage, and support on the most liberal scale to
Orange, composed the policy which it was imperative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
for England to adopt. Everything was pointing to
a Huguenot ascendency in France; Marguerite
of Valois was on the point of marrying young
Henry of Navarre, head of the Bourbons, and next
in succession to the throne after the reigning king’s
brothers. To play fast and loose with the Alençon
marriage would alienate France; to play fast and
loose with Orange would be to throw him into the
arms of France alienated from England. That
Philip, seeing England thus isolated, would cheerfully
forgive and forget all that he had suffered,
for the sake of an unstable union with her, was almost
unthinkable. Yet the months went by, and the
Ambassador could get no guidance even from the
sympathetic Burghley, who was as much in the dark
as ever as to Elizabeth’s real intentions.</p>

<p>But there was a factor in the situation of which
on one had taken full account; not Walsingham,
nor Burghley, nor Elizabeth; not the Huguenots;
not Philip nor Alva. This was Catherine de
Medici’s overwhelming lust of personal power, and
the passion of jealousy accompanying it. She saw
her ascendency over her son Charles IX. slipping
away and passing into the hands of Coligny and his
associates. For victory and vengeance, she prepared
to commit, perhaps, the most appalling crime
in the annals of Christian Europe. Paris was crowded
with Huguenots gathered to celebrate the pact of
amity, to be sealed by the wedding of the Béarnais
and the sister of the king. Stealthily and swiftly
the plans were laid, the plot organised, the preparations
completed. The wedding took place on August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
18: three days later, an unsuccessful attempt was
made to murder Coligny. It may be that if the
assassin had killed the Admiral, the huge tragedy
which followed would have been averted; as it
was, hours before the sun of St. Bartholomew’s
day (August 24) had risen, the floodgates had been
opened, and the streets of Paris were running red
with rivers of Huguenot blood. During the following
days, like scenes were being enacted through the
provinces.</p>

<p>For a moment Europe stood breathless, aghast.
Whatever this appalling thing meant, it seemed at
least an assured portent of developments undreamed
of; probably a vast, all-embracing, Catholic conspiracy.
England sprang to arms, ready to stand
at bay against the united forces of France and
Spain. If there was to be a life-and-death struggle
between the religions, she would fight to the last
gasp. The Englishmen in the French capital had
been safeguarded on the night of the massacre, but
it was some little time before they could be sure that
their turn was not still to come. Yet Walsingham in
Paris bore himself with the same lofty sternness that
the English Queen and her Council displayed to the
French Ambassador in London. It soon became
evident that Catherine was frightened at what she
had done; that her one desire was to minimise it,
to declare that matters had never been intended to
go so far, to shelter behind the plea that the victims
had been on the verge of effecting a bloody <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup
d’état</i> and the counter-stroke had only been dealt
in self-defence. Walsingham’s reply was in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
courteous but scathing incredulity. The Queen-Mother
tried to win him over by declaring that
Coligny had warned Anjou against the machinations
of England; he answered that the Admiral had
acted therein as a loyal Frenchman.</p>

<p>The diplomatic fabric had collapsed, but at least
there was no question of France holding Elizabeth to
blame for the rupture; nor was there any question
of Catherine turning to a junction with Spain.
The Huguenots now were at bay; there would be
work enough before they were either crushed or
pacified; while the slaughter of their leaders had
made the Guises more dangerous than ever. On the
other hand, there could be no joint action on
behalf of Orange. France had ruled herself out.
Walsingham would still have stood boldly for “the
Religion,” but the Queen and Burghley were not
equally ready to fling themselves single-handed into
the struggle on behalf of the Netherlands. The
Spaniards deemed the opportunity a good one for
seeking reconciliation with England. A more politic
and less bloodthirsty Governor was dispatched to the
Low Countries to take the place of Alva, who by his
own desire was recalled. Walsingham went back
to England, and for some time to come Philip and
Elizabeth were engaged in an elaborate if insincere
ostentation of amicable intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">ENTANGLEMENTS</span></h3>

<p>Burghley as Secretary had been so heavily worked
that he was in danger of breaking down; to prevent
such a catastrophe, he was made Lord Treasurer,
Walsingham on his return to England being
appointed joint Secretary of State with Sir Thomas
Smith. Leicester continued to be Burghley’s chief
rival with Elizabeth on the Council, owing to his
personal favour with her; and his political line was
the same as Walsingham’s, though the Secretary
supplied the brains. Walsingham was neither the
rival nor the follower of either; it was never in his
mind to supplant Burghley either himself or by
Leicester; but his counsels and those of the Lord
Treasurer were often in disagreement in so far as his
Protestantism was more energetic, and as he had
no sympathy with the idea of amity with Spain,
being thoroughly convinced of Philip’s fundamental
hostility to England as a Protestant Power.</p>

<p>For some years the Protestant policy was out of
court so far as Spain and the Netherlands were
concerned; the comparative moderation of the new
Governor, Requesens, giving plausibility to the
hope that a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus vivendi</i> might be arrived at&mdash;that
Philip’s maximum of concession and Orange’s
minimum of demand might prove capable of adjustment.
In Scotland, however, Walsingham and
Burghley both recognised the necessity of maintaining
friendly relations with the capable but sinister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Regent, the Earl of Morton. It was impossible to
ignore the danger of a reconstruction of parties there,
which might again result in French intervention being
invited; a consummation equally abhorrent to the
Treasurer and the Secretary. Elizabeth’s parsimony
here proved too strong for her policy. Burghley
and Walsingham both believed that liberal but
judicious expenditure would prove economical in
the long run. But the Queen would not relax the
purse-strings; the unrest of Scotland continued to
be a thorn in her side, and to be also a perpetual
strain on the anxiety of her ministers and a drain on
her Exchequer.</p>

<p>Requesens died in 1576; before his successor, Don
John, arrived, the Spanish soldiery&mdash;whose pay
was in arrear&mdash;got completely out of hand; and the
autumn saw the hideous butchery in Antwerp known
as the “Spanish Fury.” The whole of the provinces&mdash;Catholic
as well as Protestant&mdash;were united thereby
in a solid demand for the restoration of their old
constitutional privileges, and the withdrawal of
Spanish troops; and in a flat refusal to admit the
new Governor or recognise his government, until
their main demands were conceded. Don John
made provisional terms and was admitted in the
spring following; but he was known to be harbouring
audacious designs against England, the Hollanders
suspected his good faith, and the old state of
serious tension was renewed. Drake was planning
his great voyage, to the entire satisfaction of the
anti-Spanish party&mdash;but with an obvious certainty
of giving extreme offence to Philip, which caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
them to make a vain attempt to keep the thing
secret from Burghley; while Elizabeth&mdash;who liked
playing with fire and was also greedy for money&mdash;made
her own bargain with the adventurer. Thus,
in 1578 a curious state of affairs arose. Philip,
jealous of his half-brother, and still extremely
anxious to avoid a rupture with England, once more
accredited an ambassador to the English Court,
Bernardino de Mendoza, whose business was to be
conciliation; Elizabeth’s Council swayed to the
views of Walsingham and Leicester, while Burghley
seemed to be outweighted. The Queen started
on one of her most exasperating pieces of political
jugglery, snubbing Orange on the one hand, and
on the other reviving the Alençon marriage project;
while Alençon himself was now posing as a
would-be figure-head for the Huguenots, and at odds
with his brother Henry III., who had succeeded
Charles IX. two years after St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p>To his own intense disgust, Walsingham was
despatched to the Netherlands on the most
thoroughly uncongenial task that could be conceived:
one, moreover, which it would have been quite
impossible for him to accomplish even if his heart
had been in it. He was to urge the Protestant
States to accept the Spanish terms, which would
have deprived them of the exercise of their religion;
he was to refuse the promised issue of the bonds on
which they were relying for the sinews of war; in
effect, he was to represent England in what he himself
looked upon as an act of betrayal. Of course,
the mission was a failure. Betrayed or not, Orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
and his party would never accept the Spanish
terms; they would rather take the risk of a French
Protectorate, or die fighting. Walsingham loathed
the job, and wrote home in very bitter terms of the
shame the whole of the proceedings were bringing
on the name of England. The only glimmer of
satisfaction he extracted from it was in the retraction
of the monstrous breach of faith about the
bonds. It was bad enough that Elizabeth’s name
should be made a by-word for falsehood; it was
only less bad that France, instead of England, should
become for her own ends the friend and protector
of the Low Countries; it was sickening that he, of
all men, should be made the agent of such perfidy,
held personally responsible for it abroad, and
rewarded by his mistress with abuse because it
failed. “It is given out,” he wrote, “that we shall
be hanged on our return, so ill have we behaved
ourselves here: I hope we shall enjoy our ordinary
trial&mdash;my Lord Cobham [his colleague] to be tried
by his peers, and myself by a jury of Middlesex....
If I may conveniently, I mean, with the leave of God,
to convey myself off from the stage and to become
a looker-on.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, however, was far too keenly alive to
his value to allow him to become a looker-on;
nor could Burghley have spared him, however their
views might differ on some points. The Queen might
ignore his advice, but she relied on his penetration
and his loyalty, and was more afraid of his righteous
indignation than of the Lord Treasurer’s sober disapprobation.
Neither minister would countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
what they accounted perfidy, and in act she never
in the long run degraded her honour as much as she
repeatedly threatened to do. Both of them spoke
their minds. She knew they were in the right;
she resisted, abused, flouted, defied them; but she
always yielded enough, and in time, to save some
shreds of credit.</p>

<p>The death of Don John about the end of September
was followed by the appointment of Alexander of
Parma, a statesman and soldier of the first rank,
as his successor; who at the outset skilfully severed
the union between the northern or Protestant and
the southern or Catholic provinces. If Burghley
could have had his own way untrammelled, he would
have dealt straightforwardly with Orange, giving
him support enough to keep him from calling in
France, and still hoping to bring about an accommodation
with Parma possible of acceptance by both
parties. Neither he nor Walsingham now had any
belief in joint action with France, in which their
confidence had been permanently blotted out by
the Paris massacre. Neither of them, therefore,
saw good in the Alençon marriage as a genuine
project, while both saw infinite danger in merely
playing with it. They differed, as it would seem,
only as to the length they were prepared to go in
helping Orange, Burghley drawing the line at the
point where he thought Philip might be driven into
a declaration of open war, while the Secretary would
have taken bigger risks, accepting open war if
Philip chose. The Queen’s object was the same as
Burghley’s, but she elected, according to her habit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
to seek it not by straightforward, but by crooked,
courses. She would give Orange the minimum of
help, but she would, by playing with Alençon, either
keep France out of it, or else embroil France and
Spain, keeping herself out of it till she could strike
in as arbiter. To do which, she had to induce every
one to believe that she probably meant marrying,
while trusting to her own ingenuity and the chapter
of accidents to effect, if the worst came to the worst,
an escape not too ruinously ignominious. If she
really did know what she wanted, it was more than
any of her Council did, and she drove them almost
to despair.</p>

<p>So the juggling went on; the Queen blew hot and
cold with Alençon, and tried to inveigle France into
a league without a marriage; the French tried to
get the marriage secured as preliminary to a league.
Drake came home, his ship loaded with spoils;
but the remonstrances of Mendoza were met by complaints
of the assistance given by Spain to the
Desmond rebellion in Ireland. Walsingham was
flatly opposing the marriage, and the Puritan
element in the country at least was with him to a
man. Parsons and Campion, and the Jesuit propaganda,
had set Puritans and Catholics alike in a
ferment. In the summer of 1581 Alençon was
still dangling, France was still waiting to have the
marriage question settled, Philip had just annexed
Portugal, and Burghley himself was despairing of a
peaceful outcome.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Elizabeth again chose
to despatch Walsingham on an embassy to Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
He was to get the Queen out of the marriage without
upsetting the French. He was to get France to
espouse the cause of Orange, while England was
only to render secret pecuniary aid. Whether, in
the last resort, the Queen would accede to the
marriage for the sake of a secret league, or would
accede to an open league to escape the marriage, or
would positively on no condition have either
marriage or open league, or would still keep the
marriage unaccomplished but unrejected if she
could, Walsingham did not know; for whatever
instructions he received were liable to be contradicted
in twenty-four hours. He was to extract his
mistress from the tangle in which she had involved
herself, and might understand that whatever means
he found for doing so would be angrily condemned.</p>

<p>Naturally, he found the situation almost impossible.
The King and the Queen-Mother would make
an open league and let the marriage go; of that, he
felt satisfied. But they would not have an undeclared
league, nor commit themselves at any price
to any war in the Low Countries, if there were any
possible loophole for Elizabeth to back out of
supporting them. She must be so committed that
she could not back out. The suspicion that she was
only dallying both with the marriage and the league
could only be got rid of by the most straightforward
dealing, and if she would not listen to advice there
was the gravest danger that she would find France,
Spain, and Scotland all united against her. He
wrote in very plain terms that if she would not make
up her mind to a liberal expenditure, and convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
her neighbours that she had done so, ruin threatened.
The instructions from England continued to be
evasive, non-committal. The personal correspondence
between Burghley and Walsingham is particularly
interesting, as showing the complete
confidence between them, the loyalty with which
the Treasurer fought the Secretary’s battles with
the Queen, though in vain, and Walsingham’s
entire frankness to him.</p>

<p>“Sorry I am,” he writes, “to see her Majesty so
apt to take offence against me, which falleth not
out contrary to my expectation, and therefore I
did protest unto her, after it had pleased her to
make choice of me to employ me this way, that I
should repute it a greater favour to be committed
to the Tower, unless her Majesty may grow more
certain in her resolutions there.” Twelve days later
he fairly exploded in a letter to the Queen herself.
He told her point-blank that she had already lost
Scotland, and was like enough to lose England too,
by her parsimony, and finished up&mdash;“If this sparing
and improvident course be held still, the mischiefs
approaching being so apparent as they are, I conclude
therefore ... that no one that serveth in
place of a Counciller, that either weigheth his own
credit, or carrieth that sound affection to your
Majestie as he ought to do, that would not wish himself
in the farthest part of Ethiopia, rather than enjoy
the fairest palace in England. The Lord God therefore
direct your Majestie’s heart to take that way
of councel that may be most for your honour and
safety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Nothing came of the embassy; not even the
ruin foretold by Walsingham. The wonderful
Queen managed somehow to keep Alençon dangling;
and while he dangled there would be no decisive
breach with France. In November he was in
England again. She promised to marry him,
kissed him, and a few weeks later told Burghley that
she would not marry the man on any terms. The
ministers, of course, could see nothing possible but
an irreconcilable quarrel with France over the affair
sooner or later; and again Burghley’s efforts were
directed to pacifying Mendoza, and Walsingham’s
to forcing Elizabeth into openly supporting Orange.
In the Council Burghley was practically alone;
yet Walsingham could not effect his object. The
impending avalanche did not fall&mdash;and then Alençon
in effect committed suicide by trying to play the
traitor and failing ignominiously to carry out his
plot; thereby making himself obviously and hopelessly
impossible. The rupture with France on that
score was averted. His death a year later, in 1584,
made Henry of Navarre actual heir presumptive to
the crown of France; and then the question of the
succession became, and remained, so critical that all
parties in France were too hotly engaged in their
own contests to take effective part in quarrels
beyond their borders. Orange was assassinated; the
Throgmorton plot had convinced Burghley himself
that the duel with Spain was inevitable; and
in 1585 Parma’s skill brought affairs in the
Netherlands to a point at which nothing but the
armed intervention of England could apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
save the revolted provinces from utter destruction.
Before the end of the year Elizabeth was in open
league with them. At last, circumstances had
compelled her officially to commit herself to Walsingham’s
policy, though even now she could not bring
herself to resign either her systematic penuriousness
or her systematic vacillation.</p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">DETECTIVE METHODS</span></h3>

<p>Walsingham has hitherto appeared in the character
of a foreign minister or ambassador with two main
functions&mdash;to gauge the intentions of foreign courts,
and to carry out a policy with which he was dissatisfied
by methods which he abominated: the
ally of Leicester in the policy he advocated, the
ally of Burghley in his moral attitude towards the
Queen. She and Burghley were at one in the
knowledge that she must preserve Continental
Protestantism from sheer destruction, and in the
determination to limit their help, so long as it was
possible to do so, in such wise as to avoid war
with Spain. Since 1577 Walsingham had been
opposed to that limitation; in 1584 Burghley himself
was relinquishing it with reluctance, and with
the persistent hope that a reconciliation might
again become possible.</p>

<p>As a diplomatist, Sir Francis appears to have
possessed in a high degree the quality of impenetrability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the precision of veracity which has the
effect of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">suppressio veri</i> or of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">suggestio falsi</i>, misleading
of set purpose but without deviation from
formal truth. The ethics of the twentieth century
have not yet learnt to condemn skilful deception in
this kind, at any rate where it is not directed to
personal ends. But the means which, in other
capacities than that of an ambassador, Walsingham
employed for obtaining information, were not
always such as would be ventured on to-day
by a politician who was unwilling to be called
unscrupulous. Yet they were means which&mdash;so
far as they can with certainty be attributed to him&mdash;would
have been unhesitatingly sanctioned by
almost every contemporary.</p>

<p>It has to be borne in mind, in the first place, that
throughout the Elizabethan period every country
in Europe was thick with plots, with the political
intention of a violent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, or the religious
intention of removing an obnoxious personality.
While Elizabeth was on the throne the list of
successful assassinations included those of two Dukes
of Guise, a King of France, the Prince of Orange,
Darnley, Moray, and the victims of St. Bartholomew.
Attempts which only just failed were
made on Orange and Coligny. There were at least
three plots&mdash;those known by the names of Ridolfi,
Throgmorton, and Babington&mdash;in favour of Mary
Stewart, and involving the assassination of Elizabeth,
in which Philip, or some of his ministers, or the
Guises, or the Pope, or Cardinal Allen, were implicated,
besides minor ones. Rizzio’s murder was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
political; and Burghley’s life was the object of a conspiracy.
These are merely a few conspicuous instances
out of a very long roll. The ingenuity of zealots, on
either side, who honestly believed that in slaying a
leader of heretics or of persecutors they were rendering
acceptable service to the Almighty, was backed
by the unscrupulousness of politicians, who might
not, indeed, themselves be prepared to stab or
poison, but were quite ready to make use of those
who would do so. In England especially there
were vast interests involved in the removal of Elizabeth,
whose legitimate heir was, beyond all question,
the Catholic Queen of Scots. Plots merely directed
against the Queen’s person were serious enough;
but they might be combined with schemes for
invasion or concerted insurrection, like the revolt
of the northern Earls. The plotters were perfectly
unscrupulous. Nothing could be more certain than
that, so long as the Queen of Scots was alive and in
captivity, there would be a series of conspiracies,
with or without her connivance, having it as their
object to place her on the throne of England. And
we must remember, further, that, to intensify the
situation, a Papal Bull had declared that while it
was not incumbent upon Catholics in England
actively to hatch treason against the Queen of
England, it was incumbent on them to countenance,
and meritorious to take part in it.</p>

<p>With the tremendous issues at stake, both
national and religious, with the forces engaged in
setting conspiracy in motion or in encouraging it,
with the untrammelled character of its operations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
the nature of the fight was obviously very different
from anything with which modern statesmen have
to deal. Yet where active secret societies are in
existence, the police methods of modern Governments
are the police methods of Walsingham. The
spy, the paid informer, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent provocateur</i>, play
the same part now as in the sixteenth century.
It was in the risks for a Spanish ambassador or
agent that his secretary, or some other person standing
to him in a confidential relation, might be in the
pay of the English Secretary of State. Any influential
person suspected of Catholic leanings might
wake up one morning to find that a tolerably complete
copy of his correspondence was in Walsingham’s
hands. A plot, big or small, might progress
merrily while the plotters hugged themselves
on their skill and secrecy&mdash;till the psychological
moment arrived for dropping the mask, and they
found that they had merely been drawn into a carefully
prepared trap.</p>

<p>Walsingham had no qualms about employing
liars, perjurers, the basest kind of scoundrels in
this business. When he had caught his culprits
he quite deliberately applied the rack and other
forms of torture to extract evidence. He would
have argued that the Queen’s enemies had chosen
their own method of fighting, and it was legitimate
to meet them with their own weapons&mdash;as Clive
argued in the case of Omichund; that, in fact, it
was only by the use of their own weapons that he
could make sure of defeating them. Also he did
not originate the system&mdash;espionage and the rack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
were in full play when his foot was only on the lowest
rung of the ladder. Also, these methods were not
employed vindictively, but with the single object
of obtaining true information by which treasonous
designs might be frustrated. Also, in acting as
he did, he did not violate the public conscience&mdash;or
his own, with its rigid Old Testament limitations.</p>

<p>But there is one case in which he is charged with
having gone farther.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find any even approximate
parallel to the position of Mary Stewart in England.
Whatever her own attitude might be, she was the
inevitable centre of Catholic plots of the most far-reaching
order. While she lived, the throne of
Elizabeth and the triumph of the Reformation in
England could never be secure. She was held
captive on no legitimate ground, but solely because
her title to the English throne was so strong that
the Queen could not afford to set her at liberty.
In plain terms, the national security required her
death, but unless she could be convicted of plotting
against the life of Elizabeth, there was no legitimate
ground for putting her to death. The eighth Henry
would have made short work with her; there was
no European sovereign who would not have made
short work with any dangerous pretender to his
crown who lay completely in his power. Yet even
the Throgmorton conspiracy was not turned to her
destruction; Elizabeth had her own reasons for
preferring to keep her captive alive. But the Throgmorton
revelations, with the assassination of Orange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
the death of Alençon, the approach of the Spanish
crisis, and the growing certainty that Mary’s son
would not take her place as the figure-head for
Catholic conspiracies, went far to cancel Elizabeth’s
reasons. To Walsingham, alike as patriot and
protestant, the death of Mary had long been about
the most desirable event that could occur; and
now he saw his way to compass it&mdash;to inveigle her
within reach of the law.</p>

<p>He reckoned it as a certainty that if she found
herself able to communicate with her partisans
undetected, she would soon enough get involved
in some plot of a character which would justify
her doom in the eyes of the world. A supposed
adherent of hers, a Jesuit, devised means of communicating
with her and of passing her secret correspondence
in and out of Chartley Manor. She
fell into the trap: the supposed adherent was
Walsingham’s agent. Every letter was opened and
copied. A plot was soon on foot for her liberation,
an invasion, and the deposition of Elizabeth, whose
assassination by Anthony Babington was part of
the scheme. From Walsingham’s point of view,
the vital point was to get her definitely implicated
in Babington’s part of the conspiracy. At last,
Philips, the decipherer of the correspondence, produced
a letter which was decisive. Then Walsingham
struck. The bubble burst; Mary was tried
and condemned.</p>

<p>Now an issue appears between Walsingham and
Mary. The Scots Queen admitted participation in
the plot up to a certain point: she denied <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
knowledge of the intended assassination. Apart
from certain phrases in one letter, it cannot be
conclusively shown that she was lying. The conditions
made it possible that she never wrote
those incriminating phrases; that they were forged.
Did Walsingham fabricate that evidence in order
that Mary might be prevented from escaping what
he regarded as her just and necessary doom, on a
technical plea? Did Philips forge it and persuade
him that it was genuine? Or was it in fact genuine?
Mendoza believed that Mary was in the secret,
but Mendoza may have been under a misapprehension.
No one will ever be able to answer that
riddle decisively. But the form of Walsingham’s
denial, when the imputation of forgery was made in
court, is worth noting. “As a private person, I
have done nothing unbecoming an honest man,
nor, as I bear the place of a public person have I
done anything unworthy my place.” If Walsingham
did fabricate the evidence, he did it with a clear
conscience; that is, with an honest conviction that
he was discharging a duty; that he was “doing
nothing unworthy his place.” The thing is perfectly
conceivable. No one will deny that John Knox
was a conscientious man; but John Knox justified
assassination. Walsingham himself thought it permissible
in certain circumstances. But the case is
not proved one way or the other. The twist in his
rigid conscience may not have been crooked enough
for that. Yet the whole business of deliberately
making arrangements to facilitate plotting on his
victim’s part is hardly on a different plane. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
point of interest lies in the fact that under sixteenth-century
conditions such acts were committed and
were sanctioned without compunction not only by
men without conscience, or of careless conscience,
or of conventional or adaptable conscience, but by
the very men who held hardest to moral ideals:
men whose serious purpose was to do all to the glory
of God.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE END</span></h3>

<p>For all her confidence in and dependence on
Walsingham, the Secretary was never <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">persona grata</i>
with Elizabeth. She abused him more roundly and
more frequently than any other member of her
Council. If an opportunity offered of setting him a
task which was utterly against the grain, she would
not let it go; and she liked him none the better for
his share in making her responsible for the death of
Queen Mary. In that, as in passing from covert to
overt war with Spain, she was compelled to follow
his policy; but she did not increase her favour
to him and his allies, and she followed the policy
with marked ill-will. Nothing could avert a desperate
conflict, yet she continued to the last to drive
the war-party half-frantic by parsimony, by issuing
impracticable orders, by imposing paralysing restrictions,
by temporising with Parma and threatening
to betray her allies. And when the great Armada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
was triumphantly shattered by English seamen, and
thereafter overwhelmed by the winds and the
waves, and Drake would have delivered a still more
fatal blow by rending Portugal from Philip, she
carefully tied the Admiral up with instructions
which doomed the Lisbon expedition to fruitlessness
and its great organiser to discredit and practical
retirement.</p>

<p>If Walsingham lived to see England freed from
the nightmare of Mary Stewart, and on a palpable
equality with Spain, the accession of the leader of
“the Religion” in France to the throne, if not as
yet to the rulership, of that country, and the rise
of a worthy successor to William the Silent in the
person of Maurice of Nassau, yet his last years were
full enough of bitterness. He had striven devotedly
with a single eye to the welfare of his country, so
loyally and with such absence of self-seeking that
he had beggared himself in the process. His
services&mdash;invaluable yet unwelcome&mdash;were requited
by chill disfavour; the assistance to which gratitude
and justice should have entitled him was denied,
since lavish bounty to Walter Raleigh suited the
Queen’s humour better at the time; and the statesman
who with Burghley had done most, for twenty
years, for the honour and the safety of England, died
so poor that he was buried quietly and privately&mdash;at
his own desire&mdash;that his heirs might be spared
the charges of a costly funeral. Whether he was in
alliance with Burghley, or in occasional antagonism
to the policy of his great colleague, the personal
friendship and fidelity of the two to each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
remained unbroken to the end. That is almost the
only pleasing reflection to which his closing years
give rise. For the rest, he passed from the world,
one more example of the ingratitude of princes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="WALTER_RALEIGH">SIR WALTER RALEIGH</h2>

<h3>I<br />

<span class="subhead">CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p>In his virtues and in his faults, in his brilliance and
in his limitations, in his greatness and in his defects,
Walter Raleigh is the very type of Elizabeth’s
England. Like Robert Cecil, Spenser, and Sidney,
he was a child when the great queen ascended the
throne; like Shakespeare and Bacon, he had not
passed the full vigour of manhood when she died.
He was a year older than Henry of Navarre, whom
he outlived by eight years. Walsingham was a
grown man and William Cecil a Secretary of State
before any one of this younger group was born. All
of them were young men still when the crisis of
Elizabeth’s reign was reached and the Armada was
dispersed. The older generation raised England
from weakness to strength; the younger saw her
strength made patent to the world. The older
generation maintained her on the defensive; it was
the part of the younger to assert her primacy in
every field of endeavour.</p>

<p>Of this younger generation, Raleigh stands out as
the typical representative. In an age of men of
action, he was one of the greatest of the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
action. In one of the two greatest ages of English
poetry he was acclaimed as one of their peers by
the poets. In the age which saw the creation of
English prose, he was one of the masters of prose.
The military world and the naval world were developing
new theories of strategy and tactics; in both
fields he was a first-rate authority and a brilliant
performer. The expansion of Spain and Portugal
had brought new political conceptions into being;
we owe the conception of Greater Britain and all
the first stubborn efforts to realise it to the genius
of Sir Walter. In a day of brilliant courtiers, none
was more brilliant than he; and in the day when
Bacon was formulating anew the principles of scientific
inquiry, Raleigh was incidentally an ardent
experimentalist. In every field his versatility was
exercised, and in every field his place was in the
front rank.</p>

<div id="ip_362" class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;"><img src="images/i_362.jpg" width="483" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p><i>SIR WALTER RALEIGH</i></p>

<p><i>From the Painting by</i> <span class="smcap">Federigo Zuccaro</span> <i>in the National
Portrait Gallery</i></p></div></div>

<p>And yet perhaps&mdash;save in one thing&mdash;never quite
in the first rank. His literary achievement does not
set him beside Shakespeare and Spenser. Drake
was a greater commander and John Davis a greater
seaman. By land he was never tested in a great
command. His scientific pursuits were merely a
parergon. As a statesman he never achieved the
control of England’s destinies; wily Robert Cecil
was the craftier politician. But two things he did:
he taught Englishmen that the might of England
lay in her fleets&mdash;not as the accident of a moment
but as a permanent principle; and he created the
idea of a Britain beyond the seas, struggled for it
almost alone year after year with persistent tenacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
through good report and evil report and failure&mdash;finally
died for it. He it was that sowed the seed;
ours is the tree that sprang from it.</p>

<h3>II<br />

<span class="subhead">RALEIGH’S RISE</span></h3>

<p>Walter Raleigh was born in 1552, a year before
Mary Tudor ascended the English throne. He was
of a Devon house; himself, one of a large and
composite family, for his mother, Katharine Champernoun,
was his father’s third wife, and was herself
a widow with several children when she married him.
It must have counted for something for a small boy
to have had two such big half-brothers as Humphrey
and Adrian Gilbert, both dreamers and idealists, and
one of them a by-no-means contemptible man of
action to boot. The child was six years old when the
great persecution was ended by Elizabeth’s accession,
and for the next ten years he had endless opportunities
of listening with all his ears to mariners’
tales of Eldorado and of the Spanish Inquisition,
and learning at least watermanship if not seamanship.
In 1568 he went up to Oxford, at the moment when
Alva was goading the Netherlands into open rebellion
and France was on the verge of a fresh outbreak of
the Huguenot wars. Raleigh’s career as an undergraduate
was interrupted. He went off to France as
a volunteer, to get his baptism of blood at Jarnac in
March, and to be present at Montcontour later in
the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
After that, his career for some while is not easy to
trace. It looks as if he had returned to Oxford, for
his name was still on the list of undergraduates at
Oriel in 1572; but it is also said that he remained
in France for five years, and even that he was in
Paris at the time of the massacre. In 1575 he
entered&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro forma</i>&mdash;at the Middle Temple; and
two or three years later appears to have been in the
field again, fighting in the Low Countries under Sir
John Norreys. The chances are that he had had
some further military practice in the interval between
1569 and 1578, in France or the Netherlands or both,
especially as his brother Humphrey Gilbert was in
command of the English contingent at Flushing and
elsewhere for some while. In 1578 Gilbert sailed on
his first colonising venture, and young Walter was
one of his captains; but the expedition, after a
collision with some Spaniards, was driven back to
Plymouth by weather. In 1580, Raleigh emerges
definitely as a captain in the army employed for the
suppression of Desmond’s rebellion in Ireland&mdash;in
which capacity he was present at the capture of
Smerwick, and had the unsavoury business of superintending
the massacre of the garrison.</p>

<p>Raleigh remained in Ireland on duty for something
over a year, till the end of 1581. While there he
accomplished sundry feats of arms of a brilliant
character, all being of the kind in which personal
daring and skill, and resourcefulness in emergency,
are the leading characteristics&mdash;deeds in which he
was acting with only some very small escort. It
was very much in the nature&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
police work among hostile frontier tribes in India
to-day. The young soldier’s ideas of Irish government
were derived from Humphrey Gilbert, who,
in all other relations of life, was a noble-hearted
generous Christian gentleman, but in this particular
relation was as perfectly ruthless as Alva himself
might have been. It is one of the puzzles of the
period that men who upheld elsewhere the highest
standards of chivalry and honour&mdash;men such as
Sussex, Henry Sidney, Walter Devereux&mdash;adopted
towards the native Irish the attitude of the primitive
Hebrew towards the Canaanites, seeming to account
the human population as if they were an irredeemably
pernicious species of wild beasts; and Raleigh was
no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Immediately on his return to England he sprang
into high favour with Elizabeth, partly through his
brilliant abilities, partly through the personal fascination
which no one could exercise better when he
chose. But this charm was accompanied by an
insatiable ambition, pridefulness, and fiery temper,
which effectually prevented him from making any
attempt to conciliate rivalry or hostility, cut him off
from his natural alliance with the court section of the
war-party, and rather associated him with Burghley.
Favourite as he was, and in some ways influential
with the Queen, he was never admitted by her into
the Privy Council, though he was knighted so early
as 1584, and received numerous and exceedingly
substantial marks of the royal goodwill.</p>

<p>In fact, it would seem that his imagination carried
his mind away from the current problems of administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
and policy to another field. He was less
occupied with the question how war with Spain
might be precipitated or deferred than with that of
setting up a rival empire. If, as is most probable,
the conception was primarily that of his brother
Humphrey Gilbert, the younger man made it his
own; and in these years the attempt to establish a
colony in North America absorbed his best energies
and enthusiasms. For Burghley, Spain was primarily
the European Power which&mdash;however interests
might clash&mdash;was a necessary counterpoise to
France; for Walsingham, she was the aggressive
enemy of Protestantism; for Raleigh, she was the
claimant to the New World, whose rights might be
and ought to be successfully challenged by England.
Thus, the first desired to avert conflict; the second
was at least ready to join issue at once, lest it should
be too late; whereas, from Raleigh’s point of view,
the time when Spain and England should grapple
was a matter of comparative indifference, provided
that when it arrived England should be ready. But
there was probably no man in England&mdash;not Drake
himself&mdash;in whose political creed fundamental hostility
to Spain was a more essential article.</p>

<p>There is, however, a curious story that in 1586
Raleigh was engaged in Spanish negotiations on his
own account, which negotiations had as their object
that he should take measures to hamper the English
preparations for war, himself selling a couple of ships
to Spain; and it appears to be implied that he was
one of those young gentlemen about the Queen’s
person who were going to put through Babington’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
plot for her assassination. We may therefore recall
the fact that in the Ridolfi days John Hawkins had
figured as an enemy of his Queen, only thirsting to
betray the fleet to Philip. Hawkins, of course, was
really working in collusion with Burghley, and the
whole thing was a trick. It need not surprise any
one, therefore, if Raleigh played the same game at
this time, though on a smaller scale. It would be a
matter of course, then, that pains would be taken to
give the Spaniards&mdash;and their informants in England&mdash;the
impression that Sir Walter was really disaffected.
As for Ballard and Babington, they were
so completely in the toils of Walsingham from the
outset that Raleigh may very well have actually
been the Secretary’s accomplice in tricking them.
Patriotism, principle, and consistency apart, no one
has ever accused him of lacking intelligence, of which
he would stand hopelessly convicted if the suggested
allegations were true. Moreover, a man with so
many enemies would not have escaped without being
incriminated. The only definitely known facts are
that he was at this time in communication with
Spain, and that the Spaniards had an idea that he
was well-affected towards them. The only inference
we can quite confidently draw is that he was hoodwinking
them, though nothing definite seems to have
resulted.</p>

<p>When the Armada was expected, Raleigh was
Vice-Admiral of the West, and was also one of the
special Defence Commission. It was on the great
ship which he had himself designed, the <i>Ark Raleigh</i>,
that Admiral Howard hoisted his flag; but Raleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
was not one of the commanders in the fleet. He had
been largely occupied in organising the defences in
the West Country, and had been urgent in pressing
the true strategical policy of fighting and beating
the Spaniard on the sea&mdash;of an offensive naval war
as the only true defensive war. But it is not quite
certain whether he even had any personal part in the
Armada engagements at all; though, on the whole,
there is not sufficient ground for discarding the
common report that he joined the fleet as a volunteer
after the engagement off Portland. At that stage,
all fears had passed that the Spaniard might effect
a landing in the western division of the channel,
where Raleigh was responsible for the arrangements
for meeting the invader. Until then, he had been
bound to remain at his post on shore. But now,
not only did the English fleet know that it was a
match for the enemy, but, if chance should enable
them to attempt a landing, it would certainly not be
in Raleigh’s district. So there is an <i>a priori</i> probability
that, being free to join the ships, he would not
have missed the opportunity if it offered. There is
no doubt, in any case, that he fully understood and
appreciated the tactics adopted&mdash;a complete innovation
in the methods of naval warfare&mdash;whether
he did or did not take actual part, as a gentleman-volunteer,
in the manœuvres.</p>

<p>The great <i>débâcle</i> initiated a new phase in the
relations of Spain to England and to Europe generally.
The defeat, of course, was not of itself a death-blow,
though if victory had gone the other way&mdash;if the
English fleet had been in effect annihilated&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
invasion under Parma would have followed; and
Parma was the best general living, while the whole
number of Englishmen who had any real experience
of military service was small. But hitherto, wherever
the Spaniards went, afloat or ashore, they had
the prestige of success; now at a single blow the
prestige passed from Spain to England&mdash;the theory
of Spanish invincibility was shattered. The change
had no less effect on Spain’s enemies on the Continent
than in England, where for years past the seamen
at least had been in the habit of taking for granted
that they understood the art of fighting on the sea
infinitely better than their antagonists. Now, however,
the landsmen and the men of peace had had
ocular demonstration of what the sailors had long
been affirming as the conclusion from their own
practical experience. England, hitherto on the
defensive, was converted into the attacking power,
and was filled with the spirit of aggression.</p>

<h3>III<br />

<span class="subhead">VIRGINIA</span></h3>

<p>Between his seventeenth and his thirtieth years,
Raleigh was completing his education as a soldier by
his experiences in varied fields from Jarnac to
Munster&mdash;sandwiching in, as it would appear, some
residence at Oxford, and some in London as a
nominal student of the law; not actually becoming
a courtier but making his first <i>entrée</i> among the
associates of the court. In his thirtieth year he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
returned from Ireland to London, with a reputation
as a dashing officer, and immediately made his way
into the good graces of the Maiden Queen who,
already verging on fifty, was demanding with increased
instead of diminished avidity the amorous
adulation of those who would find favour in her eyes.
Raleigh made love to her on the recognised lines;
with distinguished success, also on the recognised
lines; to his own profit, and the extreme annoyance
of the Leicesters and Hattons. The famous story of
the cloak may or may not be true&mdash;it rests only on
the authority of that chronicler whom every self-respecting
author is obliged to refer to as “old
Fuller”&mdash;but it is one of those traditions which,
like King Alfred’s cakes and George Washington’s
little hatchet, can never be surrendered. In these
years there are tales of Hatton’s jealousy; records
of appeals to the favourite to intervene now on
behalf of Burghley, now of Leicester, to mitigate
the royal displeasure; rumours, such as may have
been concocted by spite, of not over-scrupulous
methods employed in the pursuit of personal aggrandisement.
Beside these stories of court-gossip and
intrigue are those of his association with Bohemian
literary circles, of his originating the meetings at
the Mermaid, of his friendship with Marlowe, and his
reputed “atheism”&mdash;a quite incredible, if by no
means surprising, charge against a man whose speculations
were probably as bold and unconventional in
the field of religion as in those of political, naval, and
military theory. But assuredly the author of the
“History of the World” was no atheist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
But during these years, between 1582 and 1588,
he was something more than the brilliant courtier,
keen-witted humanist, and active member of the
Defence Commission&mdash;he was the pioneer of colonial
expansion.</p>

<p>Humphrey Gilbert was thirteen years older than
his half-brother, whose hero he would seem to have
been, not undeservedly, in Raleigh’s younger days. Of
brilliant attainments, the bravest of the brave, intensely
religious, an idealist and dreamer, he was a
kind of incarnation of Arthurian knighthood; for the
very mercilessness he displayed in Ireland was by
no means the outcome of inhumanity but of a fixed
belief that the Irish ought to be accounted not as
human beings but as beasts of prey. Raleigh himself
was hardly more than a boy when his brother was
already fixing his thoughts on the colonisation of
North America and the discovery of the North West
Passage. It cannot therefore be claimed for Sir
Walter that he actually originated the Colonial idea,
which was Gilbert’s; but he entered into it from the
first and made it his own; while Gilbert lived, they
worked for it together; and when the Atlantic
billows swallowed up Sir Humphrey, it was to
Raleigh that his mantle passed undisputed.</p>

<p>About the time that the young man was entered at
the Temple, Sir Humphrey was at work on the
treatise “to prove a passage by the North West to
Cathay and the East Indies,” which was published
in 1576 by Gascoign. In 1578 he obtained a charter
authorising what he had already been petitioning
for four years earlier, an expedition to discover and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
take possession of unknown lands&mdash;the charter extending
over six years. We have already noted
Raleigh’s participation in the first expedition, which
put to sea late in 1579 but was obliged to return to
port with nothing accomplished. In 1583 the second
expedition sailed; but this time Raleigh, though he
had embarked everything he could in the venture,
was at the last moment peremptorily forbidden to
accompany it in person by his exigent mistress.
Quite definitely, the purpose of the expedition was
not to hunt for precious metals but to establish a
permanent agricultural settlement. Incidentally, it
is to be noted that Walsingham was active in furthering
the project. The expedition took formal
possession of Newfoundland, but this was not its
actual destination. Disasters overtook it, and Gilbert
finding himself compelled for the time to abandon the
design, sailed for England. On the course of the
voyage, the little <i>Squirrel</i>, in which he was sailing,
went down in a storm with all hands on board.
Raleigh was left to struggle single-handed for the
carrying out of his brother’s conception.</p>

<p>Now begins the story of Raleigh’s persistent effort
at the colonisation of Virginia.</p>

<p>A fresh patent was issued to Sir Walter, who had
just been knighted, in March 1584&mdash;just two years
after his first entry into Elizabeth’s court. The
first step was taken immediately&mdash;an exploring
expedition, which found its way to the island of
Roanoak on the coast of what is now Carolina,
opened friendly intercourse with the natives, took
formal possession, and returned to report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Raleigh was largely interested in the series of Arctic
voyages undertaken by John Davis during the three
ensuing years: exploration and discovery pure and
simple had an attraction for him only less powerful
than colonisation; but it was to this that he devoted
his keenest energies, and on this that he poured out
the wealth he was acquiring. In the spring of 1585
his fleet sailed for Virginia, as the new settlement was
called, under the command of his kinsman, Richard
Grenville. Raleigh himself the Queen, of course,
could not spare. The open breach with Spain and
the open alliance with Orange were now approaching
rapidly, and Grenville’s voyage seems to have been,
in his own eyes, directed more against Spaniards
than with a single eye to the colony. In due course,
however, Roanoak was reached, and the settlement
established with Ralph Lane as governor; and
Grenville came home. Unluckily, the original
friendly relations with the natives were upset; the
quarrel led the colonists into “making an example”
of an Indian village; and the Indians resolved to
retaliate. Till their opportunity should come, they
merely made things as difficult as they could for the
Englishman. A relief-expedition had been promised
for the following Easter. It did not appear; but
Drake did, with the fleet which had just been employed
in sacking Cartagena. The settlers resolved
to throw up their attempt, and returned to England
with Drake. A few days after they had sailed, the
delayed relief party under Grenville arrived to find
the settlement abandoned. Fifteen volunteers were
now left behind, to keep the place in occupation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
but when a new band of settlers with a new governor
arrived in the following spring (1587), they found that
the little garrison had been massacred. The party
set about establishing a settlement once more; but
under the existing conditions they induced John
White, the governor, to return himself to England
to bring fresh supplies and reinforcements.</p>

<p>This was the year in which the Armada ought to
have sailed against England; but Drake’s successful
raid on the harbour of Cadiz deferred the invasion
for a year. In the meantime, however, it was a
matter of extreme difficulty to get permission for
any ship to leave an English port. The demands
of the coming duel were paramount. A couple of
relief vessels with White were hardly allowed to
sail; and these returned without reaching the colony.
Again, the next year there was an expedition, but
it found Roanoak deserted, and learned that the
settlers had taken up fresh quarters. But neither
did it discover them, nor did any one of the search
expeditions which Raleigh subsequently despatched
one after another.</p>

<p>He had spent £40,000&mdash;the equivalent of something
like five times that sum at the present day.
For a dozen years his ships sailed&mdash;sometimes with
fresh settlers, sometimes with stores only; to meet
only with disappointment&mdash;often with nothing but
reports that the bones of the last party left behind
were bleaching in some undiscovered spot. Half of
the pioneers themselves were ready to turn back,
abandoning the adventure, as soon as they realised
that their business was not going to be picking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
gold and silver. Men of Grenville’s type enjoyed
themselves thoroughly when they were boarding
Spanish galleons against immense odds, or engaged
in any other form of dare-devilry; a different type
was required to settle down to a stubborn fight with
Nature, and found rural or commercial communities.
The necessary type was forthcoming in course of
time, but it had not yet realised the field that was
open to it. As yet there were none to experiment,
save adventurers who wanted something quite other
than North America had to give. At last Raleigh
felt that for a time, but only for a time, he was beaten;
that to obtain support he must have prospects to
suggest, at least, of gold mines and silver mines; and
his next great venture was in another region where
the golden city of Manoa was fabled to be hidden.
But he never lost faith in his own ideal, or recanted
his prophecy that the northern Continent would yet
be possessed and peopled by men of his own race,
that he would live to see Virginia an English nation.
His own experiment failed; yet he lived to see the
beginnings of fulfilment under other auspices, when
again a colony of Virginia received a charter in 1606&mdash;this
time to establish and maintain herself as the
mother of the American people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<h3>IV<br />

<span class="subhead">AFTER THE ARMADA</span></h3>

<p>The spirit of aggression engendered by the Armada
was too strong for Burghley and his mistress to
oppose directly. Their object was to give it such an
outlet as would satisfy popular sentiment without
ruining Spain; and popular sentiment, as they saw,
would find satisfaction in a mere extension of the
old raiding warfare upon Spanish commerce. The
danger, in their eyes, was that the control of operations
might fall into the hands of men who not only
desired to annihilate Spain but knew how to do it.
Drake and Raleigh recognised in Spain the one
Power which stood in the way of a complete English
dominion of the seas, with everything that would
mean: that dominion was already almost won, and
could be made good. But if Drake were discredited,
Raleigh would be unable to give their policy effect.
This was duly brought about by the manipulation
from headquarters of the Lisbon expedition, which
caused it to fail of accomplishing its immediate
object. Thereafter the policy was indeed anti-Spanish,
but on the lines advocated by Hawkins and
Essex (who may now be said to have taken the place
occupied by Leicester till his death in 1588), not by
Raleigh and Drake.</p>

<p>The distinction between Raleigh’s political conceptions
and those of his contemporaries marks the
transition of which he was conscious and they were
not. Their eyes were fixed upon Europe. Burghley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
calculations were always directed to the preservation
of a balance of power on the Continent; he was
afraid of France, and knew the commercial value of
the Burgundian alliance. The New World did not
appeal to him at all&mdash;a rivalry there would hardly
have seemed to him desirable. The ordinary Englishman,
on the other hand, felt that Spain had proved
herself the enemy of his country and his creed, and
in the moment of victory his views were roughly
summed up in two phrases&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vae victis</i>; and, <i>the spoils
for the victors</i>. He had no very definite ideas as to
the further results, though he might have the triumph
of “the Religion” over Popery in his mind. If he
thought of the New World, it was not as a land
where he might make himself a new home, but as a
Tom Tiddler’s ground for bold adventurers. Raleigh
saw the vision of the boundless empire occupied
by the men of his own race. There are indications
that if Walsingham had lived Raleigh would have
stood less alone; but Walsingham died, poor and in
disfavour, in 1590.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, then, for some years after
the Armada the war party at large predominated;
maintaining the system of persistent warfare on
Spanish commerce, varied at intervals with more
effective blows such as the attack on the Bretagne
forts held by the Spaniards (in league with the
Guises), and the great Cadiz expedition. In these
moves Raleigh’s voice and hand were heard and
felt; but they were isolated moves, not followed
up&mdash;largely owing to the clever management of the
Cecils, in whom the Queen really placed her reliance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
The war party itself was ruled in effect by the young
Earl of Essex, whose personality was particularly
obnoxious to the Cecils, while his policy was comparatively
acceptable to them. Essex, being desperately
jealous of Raleigh’s general favour with
the Queen, Sir Walter was generally on friendly
terms with the Cecils; whereas anything but a
very temporary show of amity between the two
Court rivals was entirely out of the question. And
whenever Essex had access to the Queen he had
the better of the contest. These controlling conditions
make Raleigh’s career at this time intelligible.</p>

<p>Both Raleigh and Essex accompanied the Lisbon
expedition in 1589. Raleigh was with Drake;
Essex, who had joined in defiance of orders, with
the land force. The fleet was in no way responsible
for the failure, though the blame was carefully laid
on Drake; Raleigh, ostensibly at any rate, rather
gained in favour with the Queen, who was extremely
angry with Essex. The Earl, however, recovered
his ascendency while his rival was in Ireland in
this same year. Then came another period of
Raleigh’s ascendency. Essex married Philip Sidney’s
widow, thereby infuriating his mistress; and, when
he had been forgiven, was not kept at Court, but
sent to command the English contingent in France
in support of the king, Henry IV.&mdash;who was warring
for his throne against the Guises, backed by Philip.
Still, the raiding policy held the field, and the naval
operations of 1590 were conducted by Hawkins and
Frobisher. The Treasure fleet, against which it was
directed, had warning and did not sail into the trap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
so that the expedition was practically a failure.
A similar expedition was planned for the next year,
in which Raleigh was to have sailed as Vice-Admiral,
Lord Thomas Howard being in command; but,
Essex being in France, Elizabeth would not spare
him, and Grenville went instead, to meet his death
in the last famous fight of the <i>Revenge</i>. The next
year, Raleigh and the Earl of Cumberland had a
great enterprise on hand; but, again, Raleigh was
ordered to turn back and resign his command to
Frobisher.</p>

<p>At this time Sir Walter fell into complete disgrace
at Court, partly because he did not at first obey
the Queen’s orders, partly because of the discovery
of his <i>liaison</i> with Elizabeth Throgmorton, who
became his wife&mdash;whether he was already secretly
married to her is a matter of some doubt. He was
placed in confinement, and wrote the most outrageous
letters to Robert Cecil anent the misery of being
deprived of the sunshine of the Royal presence; in
the then conventional form of adulation for Gloriana.
He was more or less forgiven when the ships under
the command of his lieutenant, Borough, returned,
with a very rich prize, of the value whereof Elizabeth
took one-half for herself. Incidentally, the whole
story of this enterprise shows that Raleigh could
make himself as popular with sailors as unpopular
elsewhere; for the crews nearly mutinied when
they found he was to be displaced by Frobisher;
and after they landed, Robert Cecil was quite perturbed
at the discovery of their devotion to him,
their wrath at his imprisonment, and his influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
over them when he was sent down to the port to
keep matters straight.</p>

<p>Raleigh was released, but he no longer basked
in the sunshine of the Virgin Queen’s favour, and
lived away from the Court, spending much of his
time at his newly acquired estate of Sherborne.
About this time his rival, returned from France, was
admitted to the Privy Council, from which he
himself was still excluded; but he became active
in Parliament, in private matters relating to his
various estates, and in planning his great expedition
for the “discovery of Guiana”; while he was also
an energetic advocate of the policy of expelling the
Spaniards from Brittany, relying&mdash;in full accord
with the school of Drake&mdash;on the navy as England’s
instrument for fighting her great foe. The persuasive
eloquence of his tongue would seem to have equalled
the picturesque force of his pen, which had been
displayed in more than one pamphlet, notably in his
extremely vivid account of the great fight in which
his kinsman Grenville lost his life&mdash;where his
narrative powers are associated with a singularly
telling rhetorical invective directed against the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>For a dozen years past, however, Raleigh had
hardly put to sea in his own person, or seen much
fighting. In 1595 he reappears as emphatically a
man of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<h3>V<br />

<span class="subhead">FAVOUR AND FALL</span></h3>

<p>The Virginia project was for the time abandoned,
since it had become clear that no serviceable co-operation
could be expected from any quarter. If the
establishment of a working colony in North America
was out of his power, Raleigh came to the conclusion
that territorial acquisitions on the southern continent
might prove more attractive. Rumour declared
that the Peruvian Incas had set up in the interior
a new empire, known as Guiana, whose capital
was the golden city of Manoa; Spanish attempts to
penetrate inland had failed. If England established
her sovereignty in the heart of South America,
taking possession of what was believed to be the
richest country in the world, the most short-sighted
could see what a prospect was offered of dominating
her rival, in the field to which that rival laid
exclusive claim; and the most avaricious might
anticipate opportunities of accumulating enormous
wealth.</p>

<p>So Raleigh organised his expedition for the
exploration of the Orinoco in 1595, taking command
of it in person. The record of it we have
from his own pen. As a matter of course, he had
sundry collisions with the Spaniards, very much of
his own seeking, capturing Berreo, the Governor of
Trinidad, from whom he extracted a certain amount
of information. Then he made his way some distance
up the great river, enduring many hardships, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
many strange sights, and gathering still more
astonishing reports; collecting also samples of ore
which suggested the auriferous character of the
district. It seems, however, a somewhat curious
omission on his part that he had sailed without
proper means either for mining or assaying. In
all other respects he proved himself an extremely
competent explorer, in especial recognising the
necessity of cultivating&mdash;in contrast to the Spaniards&mdash;the
confidence and friendliness of the natives;
carrying out his scheme, not on the hypothesis of
bringing home the maximum of loot, but of preparing
the way for the systematic entry of England into
a great inheritance. He was again doomed to disappointment.
The Cecils at this period were cooperating
with him cautiously, but he could still
get no other support; the Queen was minded to
participate royally in profits, but she preferred to
leave all the risks to others&mdash;and the others preferred
the immediate return from raids to any systematic
and laborious methods, however paying in the long
run. Moreover, the credit which Sir Walter gave
to apparently authentic but fabulous tales of
Amazons and men whose heads do grow beneath
their shoulders, brought undeserved discredit on the
explorer’s account of what he had actually seen.
In short, the result of his adventure seemed very
likely to be, that adventurers with very different
methods would visit Guiana in search of Eldorado;
but the beginnings of an English Empire in America
were brought no nearer.</p>

<p>By this time Elizabeth was awaking to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
that Spain’s power of aggression on the seas had
by no means disappeared; and Drake had once
more been called into counsel. In the winter of
1595, the great seaman and his old colleague and
rival John Hawkins were in joint command of a
new Panama expedition, in the course of which
both of them died. The Cadiz expedition next year
was the fruit of the more efficient policy which was
being forced to the front by circumstances. General
reconciliation was the order of the day in England;
the Cecils, the Howards, Raleigh, and Essex were all
on formal terms of alliance. Philip was making
great naval preparations, when an English force
appeared off Cadiz; Essex was the General, Effingham
the Admiral; his cousin, Lord Thomas Howard
and Raleigh, were both on the War Council. Effingham
wished to land the soldiers and attack the
town; Raleigh, who had been absent from the
Council of War, appeared in time to get a hearing;
the decision arrived at was reversed, and Raleigh
in his vessel headed the squadron as it sailed into
Cadiz harbour. There is no doubt that Sir Walter
was the hero of the occasion, setting the example
of doing the right thing in the right way. The
result was that thirteen of Philip’s best warships
were sunk or captured, a great fleet of forty sail
packed full of riches was taken or burnt, and Cadiz
itself was sacked completely and thoroughly, while
the persons of the inhabitants were protected and
cared for with a most unaccustomed generosity.
Raleigh’s own narrative&mdash;he was badly wounded
during the engagement&mdash;gives the fullest account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
the proceedings, but is in the main substantiated
by other evidence; and if he had no qualms about
asserting the merits of his own performance, he
was also at pains to emphasise with generous frankness
the frank generosity displayed towards him
by his personal rival. In all the relations between
him and Essex, this is the pleasantest&mdash;one might
almost say the only really pleasing&mdash;episode.</p>

<p>At last Raleigh was restored to Court favour;
but for a time a superficial friendliness with Essex
was maintained, and the pair were again united
with Lord Thomas Howard in the following year in
what was known as the Islands voyage: a futile
performance, in which the English fleet had the
worst of luck in respect of weather, and Essex,
who was in supreme command, showed grave incompetence&mdash;which
was hardly unnatural, since he
was quite inexperienced in naval warfare and knew
nothing whatever of naval strategy. At one stage
Raleigh, awaiting Essex off Fayal (in the Azores),
with orders not to attack till the whole force was
assembled, found sufficient reason, after some days’
delay, for effecting the capture of the place on his own
responsibility&mdash;to the extreme annoyance of Essex.
The action was executed with brilliant courage and
success; but the Earl’s anger was with difficulty
appeased, and the old animosity between the rivals
was to a great extent revived by the incident.</p>

<p>For a time, however, Raleigh was not much at
Court. But Essex, who was popular with the
mob, as the other was not, was jealous of every one,
and nearly every one was jealous of Essex. Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Lord Burghley died, and a considerable part of the
story of the Queen’s last years is really the story of
the crafty intriguing by which Robert Cecil first
urged Essex to the ruin on which he was ready
enough to rush, and then laid his mines for the
destruction of Raleigh&mdash;while carefully avoiding
the odium in both cases. Essex, when in Ireland,
acquired a fixed idea that Sir Walter was the
principal person whose machinations were compassing
his downfall; but there is little enough
reason to suppose that he had any one but himself
to thank. The only effective machinations were
those of the people who covertly encouraged his own
arrogance and misconduct. Nevertheless, it is
matter of regret that when Essex fell, Raleigh&mdash;who
had recently received insults from him&mdash;did
take a vindictive line, while Cecil was posing as the
advocate of magnanimity.</p>

<p>A sketch such as this does not permit of an examination
of the intricate plottings that surrounded
the old Queen as she was wearing rapidly to her grave.
Roughly speaking, the English Catholics outside the
country were zealous for the quite impossible succession
of Philip III. of Spain&mdash;a plan which did not
appeal to the Catholics in England. There were
schemes for the succession of that monarch’s sister,
which found supporters only on the basis of her
uniting the crowns of the Netherlands and England,
in independence of Spain. There were ideas of
marrying Arabella Stewart and Lord Beauchamp&mdash;each
of whom had some sort of title&mdash;with the object
of preventing the accession of James VI., whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
claim on purely legitimist grounds was quite indisputable.
Cecil, satisfied that James was the winning
candidate, made it his business to convince that
prince that his peaceful accession would be entirely
due to Cecil’s own masterly management, and that
Raleigh in particular was extremely antagonistic;
while Raleigh himself was at no pains to curry favour
with the Scots king.</p>

<p>Scarcely was Elizabeth dead and James on the
throne when a plot for his removal and the substitution
of Arabella was brought to light, and Raleigh
was charged with having sold himself to Spain and
being a principal agent in the conspiracy, which
involved the introduction of Spanish troops. The
conduct of the trial was a monstrous perversion of
justice, and Raleigh was condemned as a traitor.
Apart from the inadequacy of the evidence and the
palpable fact that it was full of contradictions and
of perjury, it remains incredible that Raleigh should
ever have seriously intended to support a Spanish
domination. It would not only have been a flat
contradiction of his whole career, a merely amazing
folly in the man who in all England was the
most absolutely convinced of the rottenness of the
power of Spain; there was also no man alive who
more thoroughly appreciated the historical truth,
that he who sells his own country to her enemies
purchases for himself not power and confidence but
suspicion and contempt. The part of Themistocles
would not have attracted him. He might have been
capable of playing a selfish game; he was certainly
not likely to play a consciously unpatriotic one; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
the game attributed to him by his enemies would
have been in his own eyes not only unpatriotic, but,
from the selfish point of view, egregiously stupid.</p>

<h3>VI<br />

<span class="subhead">CAPTIVE AND VICTIM</span></h3>

<p>Raleigh was condemned to die as a traitor; but
the sentence was not carried out. Instead, he was
relegated to the Tower, and was there held a prisoner
for twelve years&mdash;mainly occupied in scientific and
literary pursuits, varied by petitions for release.
His chemical experiments may be accounted as a
hobby; but his writings would have assured his
fame had he possessed no other claim to recognition.
They range over the whole field of what the Greeks
included under the term “politics”&mdash;economics, the
art of war, the art of government, political institutions,
as well as other subjects. The incidental
discourses on such matters, illustrated from the
events <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quorum pars magna fuerat</i>, with his comments
thereon, give the main permanent interest to his
“History of the World”&mdash;in itself a monument of
such historical learning as was available in his day.
On every subject he touched he wrote with a knowledge
of facts and a penetrating perception of causes
which distinguish him as a political thinker of a
high order; alive, like Thomas More, to truths
which had hardly won general recognition two
centuries after he was in his grave. He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
in the great days had been the intimate of
Edmund Spenser was in the days of his captivity
on terms of friendship with Ben Jonson. He, too,
wrote poetry, but this was for him rather in the
nature of an intellectual exercise or accomplishment
than of a creative order; little that can with certainty
be attributed to him has been handed down,
though that little includes lines (like “The Lie” and
the sonnet to Spenser) which are immortal, assuring
him his place on the English Helicon. But his
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnum opus</i> was that “History of the World”
which King James condemned because it spoke too
“saucily” of the doings of princes, but which was
ranked by Oliver Cromwell next to his Bible.</p>

<p>Raleigh’s condemnation produced a curious effect.
Hitherto, he had been able to win the devotion of the
few chosen intimates whom he accounted his intellectual
peers, and of the mariners who sailed under
his command, who adored him in much the same
way and for the same reasons as they adored Francis
Drake. Among courtiers his open and aggressive
consciousness of intellectual superiority and his
scornful attitude made him intensely unpopular;
and he was the pet aversion of the mob, who had
made a hero of Essex and regarded him as the Earl’s
principal enemy. Yet the sense that he was a
victim of gross injustice, the dignity and eloquence
he displayed at his trial, the contrast between this
typical Elizabethan and the minions of the new
Stewart Court, brought about a revulsion of sentiment,
and Raleigh in the Tower became an object of admiration,
and to Henry Prince of Wales of hero-worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
A curious psychological study is afforded by Sir
Walter’s letters when he was lying under sentence of
death. He condescended to appeal to the king for
mercy in terms which can only be called abject; yet
the ink was scarcely dry when he was writing to his
wife with tender affection and beautiful dignity.
The conclusion afforded by a comparison of the
documents is that his personal attitude towards
death was that expressed in the letter to his wife, but
that for the sake of his family he felt bound to appeal
for life, and the only form of appeal from which
anything might be hoped must be couched in that
style of pitiful self-abasement and fulsome flattery
which he adopted&mdash;and by which he felt himself
degraded.</p>

<p>While Robert Cecil lived there was never much
hope of liberty for Sir Walter, who yet seems never
to have realised that his old friend and colleague was,
under the surface, his most determined enemy. But
the prisoner, though now advanced in years&mdash;he was
already fifty-one at the time of the trial&mdash;never
ceased to dream of Eldorado, and to petition for
liberty in order to make one more expedition to
Guiana. Cecil died; the rising favourite, Villiers,
was a person whose influence could be secured&mdash;at
a price; and at last, after more than twelve years
of captivity, Raleigh was released, to prepare for his
last voyage. But the attitude of England to Spain
had changed since Elizabeth’s death: the ambassador
Gondomar could twist King James round
his little finger. Raleigh meant to win his golden
empire, and incidentally to teach the old lesson of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Spanish incapacity over again; Gondomar intended
to use that expedition for Raleigh’s destruction. Sir
Walter played the game on the old familiar theory
of twenty&mdash;thirty&mdash;forty years before: that success
would excuse proceedings unauthorised, and even
forbidden. Every soul, from the king down, knew
perfectly well that if the adventurer did not set
Spain at defiance, the adventure itself would be a
stupid farce.</p>

<p>So the greatest living Englishman was sent forth
to his carefully prepared destruction, to entangle
himself in the toils laid by, and at the bidding of,
the minister of England’s old foe. Of course, under
the conditions the expedition was a disastrous failure.
Raleigh returned from it with a perfect knowledge
that he was coming back to irretrievable ruin and
disgrace. It would have been easy enough for him
to find refuge in a French port; that he deliberately
faced his fate is sufficient proof that the charge of
his having already sold himself to France was a base
slander. Raleigh’s enemies were everlastingly accusing
him of selling himself; they never produced
a scintilla of proof, and the sales were singularly
unremunerative to a man who was as careful of his
own interests as any one when he did drive a bargain.
He had hardly landed in Plymouth when he was
placed under arrest. Even now he had an opportunity
of escaping to France, but he refused to avail
himself of it. His doom was a foregone conclusion;
the death sentence passed on him in 1603 had never
been cancelled.</p>

<p>He bore himself worthily; with the fortitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
dignity which were almost a commonplace with
Englishmen of the Tudor tradition. The king of
England, Elizabeth’s successor, struck off the head
of the last of the Elizabethan heroes, at the orders of
the king of Spain. But the degradation was only
for a time. Spain had laid her enemy low; but the
lesson he had spent his life to teach his countrymen
was bearing its fruit even in the hour of his doom;
to the men of Raleigh’s race was destined the Empire
of the seas, and of the new worlds which Spain had
arrogantly claimed.</p>
